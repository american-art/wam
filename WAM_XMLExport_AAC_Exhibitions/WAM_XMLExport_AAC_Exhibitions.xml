        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Great Illustrations: Drawings and Books from the Walters' Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Through a selection of drawings and books, this exhibition explores the variety of ways in which 19th-century artists approached the idea of illustration. It features seldom-seen works from the permanent collection, including drawings for Gustave Dore's Holy Bible (1866) and Paul Gavarni’s lively sketches of the London underworld. French, American and British artists' responses to the works of William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Jonathan Swift join in the volumes in which they were published.

With the birth of lithography and the widespread use of steel and wood engraving, the 19th century saw an explosion in the art of illustration. Illustrated newspapers, magazines and literature, aimed at both adults and children, became more widely available than ever before. For the first time the very latest images by the most fashionable artists could be owned and enjoyed by people at all levels of society. This mass circulation of images also encouraged collectors to place new value on exceptional and personal expressions, seeking out illustrated autographs and assembling albums of sketches. The 15 works in this exhibition reveal both the popular art of published illustrations and the unique images sought by collectors, which brought literature and images together in fresh and illuminating ways.

This is a focus show on view in the 4th floor Drawing Gallery.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Great Illustrations: Drawings and Books from the Walters' Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Through a selection of drawings and books, this exhibition explores the variety of ways in which 19th-century artists approached the idea of illustration. It features seldom-seen works from the permanent collection, including drawings for Gustave Dore's Holy Bible (1866) and Paul Gavarni’s lively sketches of the London underworld. French, American and British artists' responses to the works of William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Jonathan Swift join in the volumes in which they were published.

With the birth of lithography and the widespread use of steel and wood engraving, the 19th century saw an explosion in the art of illustration. Illustrated newspapers, magazines and literature, aimed at both adults and children, became more widely available than ever before. For the first time the very latest images by the most fashionable artists could be owned and enjoyed by people at all levels of society. This mass circulation of images also encouraged collectors to place new value on exceptional and personal expressions, seeking out illustrated autographs and assembling albums of sketches. The 15 works in this exhibition reveal both the popular art of published illustrations and the unique images sought by collectors, which brought literature and images together in fresh and illuminating ways.

This is a focus show on view in the 4th floor Drawing Gallery.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Essence of Line: French Drawings from Ingres to Degas</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>For the first time, the renowned collections of 19th-century French drawings from The Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum were the subject of a major joint exhibition presented at each museum. The Essence of Line featured more than 150 rarely shown drawings and watercolors by some of the most influential French artists of the 19th century, including Eugene Delacroix, Honore Daumier, Paul Cezanne, and Edgar Degas. From revealing preparatory sketches to beautiful finished watercolors, these works surveyed the astonishing range of French art over the course of a century of innovation--neoclassical landscapes and symbolist fantasies, narrative scenes and poignant views of peasant life, and bawdy caricatures and social satire. The exhibition featured a comprehensive catalogue combining the works from both institutions and a searchable online database of French works on paper in the collections of the Walters, the BMA, and the Peabody Art Collection: Maryland State Archives. The exhibition was organized by The Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum with funding provided by The Richard C. von Hess Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. The Walters venue was generously supported by Stephanie and Jay Wilson, Millicent and Peter Bain, and Eleanor Abell Owen.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Miniatures of William J. Baer</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Baer (1860–1941) was a leading exponent of the idealized image in America at the end of the 19th century. Until 1892, he specialized in portraits and scenes of daily life; for the remainder of his career, he devoted himself to miniatures. This small focus installation highlighted six of his works, including two of his best-known “idealized” subjects and three miniatures of members of the Walters family.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Miniatures of William J. Baer</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Baer (1860–1941) was a leading exponent of the idealized image in America at the end of the 19th century. Until 1892, he specialized in portraits and scenes of daily life; for the remainder of his career, he devoted himself to miniatures. This small focus installation highlighted six of his works, including two of his best-known “idealized” subjects and three miniatures of members of the Walters family.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Great Illustrations: Drawings and Books from the Walters' Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Through a selection of drawings and books, this exhibition explores the variety of ways in which 19th-century artists approached the idea of illustration. It features seldom-seen works from the permanent collection, including drawings for Gustave Dore's Holy Bible (1866) and Paul Gavarni’s lively sketches of the London underworld. French, American and British artists' responses to the works of William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Jonathan Swift join in the volumes in which they were published.

With the birth of lithography and the widespread use of steel and wood engraving, the 19th century saw an explosion in the art of illustration. Illustrated newspapers, magazines and literature, aimed at both adults and children, became more widely available than ever before. For the first time the very latest images by the most fashionable artists could be owned and enjoyed by people at all levels of society. This mass circulation of images also encouraged collectors to place new value on exceptional and personal expressions, seeking out illustrated autographs and assembling albums of sketches. The 15 works in this exhibition reveal both the popular art of published illustrations and the unique images sought by collectors, which brought literature and images together in fresh and illuminating ways.

This is a focus show on view in the 4th floor Drawing Gallery.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Portraits Re-Examined: Dawoud Bey Project</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>This artist-in-residence project will take place in conjunction with the Contemporary Museum’s exhibition Class Picture, featuring photographs by celebrated American artist Dawoud Bey, who for the past several years has created portraits of young people challenging stereotypes about urban youth.  During Bey's artist-in-residency project, the artist collaborated with 12 teenagers from several Baltimore-area public, private, and home schools in a summer workshop that began with an exploration of how race, class and identity have been addressed in portraiture throughout art history. The Walters' collection became the basis for discussions about museum practice, its role in society and the role of contemporary art in museums with historical collections.  The resulting focus exhibition Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project, curated by Bey and the teens, features 10 photographic portraits by Bey, juxtaposed with paintings, drawings, and portrait miniatures from the Walters' collection to create a unique dialogue.
Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project is presented by the Contemporary Museum in collaboration with the Walters Art Museum. This project is made possible by a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.  Additional support is provided by Carol and Alan Edelman, Sayra and Neil Meyerhoff, and The Paige Family Foundation.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Essence of Line: French Drawings from Ingres to Degas</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>For the first time, the renowned collections of 19th-century French drawings from The Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum were the subject of a major joint exhibition presented at each museum. The Essence of Line featured more than 150 rarely shown drawings and watercolors by some of the most influential French artists of the 19th century, including Eugene Delacroix, Honore Daumier, Paul Cezanne, and Edgar Degas. From revealing preparatory sketches to beautiful finished watercolors, these works surveyed the astonishing range of French art over the course of a century of innovation--neoclassical landscapes and symbolist fantasies, narrative scenes and poignant views of peasant life, and bawdy caricatures and social satire. The exhibition featured a comprehensive catalogue combining the works from both institutions and a searchable online database of French works on paper in the collections of the Walters, the BMA, and the Peabody Art Collection: Maryland State Archives. The exhibition was organized by The Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum with funding provided by The Richard C. von Hess Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. The Walters venue was generously supported by Stephanie and Jay Wilson, Millicent and Peter Bain, and Eleanor Abell Owen.</ExhBoilerText>

William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings.

Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries.

Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature.

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Miniatures of William J. Baer</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Baer (1860–1941) was a leading exponent of the idealized image in America at the end of the 19th century. Until 1892, he specialized in portraits and scenes of daily life; for the remainder of his career, he devoted himself to miniatures. This small focus installation highlighted six of his works, including two of his best-known “idealized” subjects and three miniatures of members of the Walters family.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Schatzkammer: Henry Walters' German Manuscripts</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In his pursuit of a rich collection of illuminated manuscripts, Henry Walters amassed a small but high-quality group of medieval books from the German-speaking lands that comprise present-day Germany and Austria. These Gospel books, liturgical manuscripts, prayerbooks, and theological texts received luxurious decoration, reflecting the concept of the Schatzkammer, or treasury, where the costliest books were often kept in the Middle Ages. This exhibition introduces the visitor to 25 German manuscripts and leaves from the 9th through the 16th century, many of which have rarely been on display, and never before shown as a group.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>This collaborative exhibition of 91 prints, drawings, and northern European woodcut-illustrated books was drawn from the collections of the Walters, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Eisenhower Library at the Johns Hopkins University. Dating from the early 15th century through about 1550, the works are examples of those that influenced Durer's achievements, his own books, and those that were produced in the wake of his successful publications.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures: Orientalism in America, 1870-1930</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures traces America's fascination with an imagined, exotic Middle East, from the high-art of John Singer Sargent's Fumée d'ambre gris to the popular-art of Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik. The exhibition breaks new ground by drawing on the expertise of scholars specializing in Islamic art and culture to look at the role of Orientalism in America during a key period in the nation's development.
This rich history is documented through more than one hundred paintings, works of decorative art, photographs, sheet music illustrations, Shriner memorabilia, advertisements, high-fashion items, and film clips, many of which are rarely seen even in reproduction.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures: Orientalism in America, 1870-1930</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures traces America's fascination with an imagined, exotic Middle East, from the high-art of John Singer Sargent's Fumée d'ambre gris to the popular-art of Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik. The exhibition breaks new ground by drawing on the expertise of scholars specializing in Islamic art and culture to look at the role of Orientalism in America during a key period in the nation's development.
This rich history is documented through more than one hundred paintings, works of decorative art, photographs, sheet music illustrations, Shriner memorabilia, advertisements, high-fashion items, and film clips, many of which are rarely seen even in reproduction.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Portraits Re-Examined: Dawoud Bey Project</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>This artist-in-residence project will take place in conjunction with the Contemporary Museum’s exhibition Class Picture, featuring photographs by celebrated American artist Dawoud Bey, who for the past several years has created portraits of young people challenging stereotypes about urban youth.  During Bey's artist-in-residency project, the artist collaborated with 12 teenagers from several Baltimore-area public, private, and home schools in a summer workshop that began with an exploration of how race, class and identity have been addressed in portraiture throughout art history. The Walters' collection became the basis for discussions about museum practice, its role in society and the role of contemporary art in museums with historical collections.  The resulting focus exhibition Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project, curated by Bey and the teens, features 10 photographic portraits by Bey, juxtaposed with paintings, drawings, and portrait miniatures from the Walters' collection to create a unique dialogue.
Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project is presented by the Contemporary Museum in collaboration with the Walters Art Museum. This project is made possible by a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.  Additional support is provided by Carol and Alan Edelman, Sayra and Neil Meyerhoff, and The Paige Family Foundation.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>This first ever comprehensive survey of Russian enamels will focus on 120 enamels drawn from The Walters' holdings of early - especially 17th century - Russian enamels, Hillwood Museum's world-renowned collection of 18th and 19th century Russian enamels, and an extraordinarily refined and rich private collection of Russian Revival pieces to present a broad overview of Russian enameling illustrated with key pieces, many of which, despite their importance, are not well known to the public or scholarly community.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Miniatures of William J. Baer</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Baer (1860–1941) was a leading exponent of the idealized image in America at the end of the 19th century. Until 1892, he specialized in portraits and scenes of daily life; for the remainder of his career, he devoted himself to miniatures. This small focus installation highlighted six of his works, including two of his best-known “idealized” subjects and three miniatures of members of the Walters family.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Miniatures of William J. Baer</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Baer (1860–1941) was a leading exponent of the idealized image in America at the end of the 19th century. Until 1892, he specialized in portraits and scenes of daily life; for the remainder of his career, he devoted himself to miniatures. This small focus installation highlighted six of his works, including two of his best-known “idealized” subjects and three miniatures of members of the Walters family.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Great Illustrations: Drawings and Books from the Walters' Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Through a selection of drawings and books, this exhibition explores the variety of ways in which 19th-century artists approached the idea of illustration. It features seldom-seen works from the permanent collection, including drawings for Gustave Dore's Holy Bible (1866) and Paul Gavarni’s lively sketches of the London underworld. French, American and British artists' responses to the works of William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Jonathan Swift join in the volumes in which they were published.

With the birth of lithography and the widespread use of steel and wood engraving, the 19th century saw an explosion in the art of illustration. Illustrated newspapers, magazines and literature, aimed at both adults and children, became more widely available than ever before. For the first time the very latest images by the most fashionable artists could be owned and enjoyed by people at all levels of society. This mass circulation of images also encouraged collectors to place new value on exceptional and personal expressions, seeking out illustrated autographs and assembling albums of sketches. The 15 works in this exhibition reveal both the popular art of published illustrations and the unique images sought by collectors, which brought literature and images together in fresh and illuminating ways.

This is a focus show on view in the 4th floor Drawing Gallery.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Portraits Re-Examined: Dawoud Bey Project</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>This artist-in-residence project will take place in conjunction with the Contemporary Museum’s exhibition Class Picture, featuring photographs by celebrated American artist Dawoud Bey, who for the past several years has created portraits of young people challenging stereotypes about urban youth.  During Bey's artist-in-residency project, the artist collaborated with 12 teenagers from several Baltimore-area public, private, and home schools in a summer workshop that began with an exploration of how race, class and identity have been addressed in portraiture throughout art history. The Walters' collection became the basis for discussions about museum practice, its role in society and the role of contemporary art in museums with historical collections.  The resulting focus exhibition Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project, curated by Bey and the teens, features 10 photographic portraits by Bey, juxtaposed with paintings, drawings, and portrait miniatures from the Walters' collection to create a unique dialogue.
Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project is presented by the Contemporary Museum in collaboration with the Walters Art Museum. This project is made possible by a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.  Additional support is provided by Carol and Alan Edelman, Sayra and Neil Meyerhoff, and The Paige Family Foundation.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Miniatures of William J. Baer</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Baer (1860–1941) was a leading exponent of the idealized image in America at the end of the 19th century. Until 1892, he specialized in portraits and scenes of daily life; for the remainder of his career, he devoted himself to miniatures. This small focus installation highlighted six of his works, including two of his best-known “idealized” subjects and three miniatures of members of the Walters family.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Portraits Re-Examined: Dawoud Bey Project</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>This artist-in-residence project will take place in conjunction with the Contemporary Museum’s exhibition Class Picture, featuring photographs by celebrated American artist Dawoud Bey, who for the past several years has created portraits of young people challenging stereotypes about urban youth.  During Bey's artist-in-residency project, the artist collaborated with 12 teenagers from several Baltimore-area public, private, and home schools in a summer workshop that began with an exploration of how race, class and identity have been addressed in portraiture throughout art history. The Walters' collection became the basis for discussions about museum practice, its role in society and the role of contemporary art in museums with historical collections.  The resulting focus exhibition Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project, curated by Bey and the teens, features 10 photographic portraits by Bey, juxtaposed with paintings, drawings, and portrait miniatures from the Walters' collection to create a unique dialogue.
Portraits Re/Examined: A Dawoud Bey Project is presented by the Contemporary Museum in collaboration with the Walters Art Museum. This project is made possible by a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.  Additional support is provided by Carol and Alan Edelman, Sayra and Neil Meyerhoff, and The Paige Family Foundation.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters.

Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature.

        <ExhTitle>The American Artist as Painter and Draftsman</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>During the 19th century, American artists produced drawings and watercolors for various purposes, including sketches of nature for future use, studies for the composition of paintings, finished productions for sale, and personal exercises. Some artists ranked their works on paper as highly as they did their oil paintings, but, for others, drawings were either incidental or secondary creations intended for their own use. William T. Walters was a pioneer in collecting drawings and watercolors by American artists. In this exhibition, 26 oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors by nine prominent painters in the Walters' collection were displayed together to invite the viewer to draw comparisons.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Recollections of Alfred Jacob Miller</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters excels in its holdings of works by the local artists Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874), who gained renown for his paintings and watercolors recording the fur trade in the American West. This exhibition will show works selected from a collection of drawings recently presented to the museum. These include studies after Old Masters, views of local sites and scenery, and illustrations of literature and comical subjects. They provide a rare insight into the life and times of the artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Recollections of a Baltimore Artist: Sketches by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874)</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>Alfred Jacob Miller is most widely known as the artist who recorded the early American fur-trade, but he also earned his livelihood painting portraits and copies of Old Masters. Familiar only to his closest associates were the countless sketches that he produced for his own enjoyment and that of his friends. Included in this exhibition are a selection of 37 humorous sketches in which he recalls his youth in downtown Baltimore, his travels at home and abroad, and his favorite literature. These sketches provide a unique insight into popular culture as interpreted by a well-informed artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Alfred Jacob Miller and the Western Indians</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>In 1837, Baltimore painter Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-74) was hired by Captain William Drummond Stewart, an eccentric Scottish adventurer, to journey to the animal fur-traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming) and to document the trip in paintings. Organized by the American Fur Company, the rendezvous provided mountain men and Native Americans with an opportunity to come together to exchange their furs for supplies that would sustain them through the winter. Represented at the gathering were members of the Sioux, Bannock, Mandan, Crow, Snake, Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Cheyenne, and Delaware tribes. Miller supported himself for the rest of his career by painting oils and watercolors based on his "trail sketches," 200 of which were commissioned by William T. Walters.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Recollections of Alfred Jacob Miller</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters excels in its holdings of works by the local artists Alfred Jacob Miller (1810-1874), who gained renown for his paintings and watercolors recording the fur trade in the American West. This exhibition will show works selected from a collection of drawings recently presented to the museum. These include studies after Old Masters, views of local sites and scenery, and illustrations of literature and comical subjects. They provide a rare insight into the life and times of the artist.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>The Walters' American Collection</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>While strong in many types of art, the Walters has only a relatively small number of American works. William Walters first collected American art, but, while living abroad, he became interested in European art and sold most of his American holdings. Henry Walters acquired some American works, but he never consistently tried to expand his collecting in this field. Since opening a public museum in 1934, the Walters has been given paintings by American artists, many of which were once displayed in the parlors of William Walters' Baltimore contemporaries. This small exhibition featured 14 paintings by American artists.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhBoilerText>This exhibition featured eleven works drawn from the collections of the Walters, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (including the spectacular Rubens Peale with a Geranium Pot), the Maryland Historical Society, and the Atwater Kent Museum of Philadelphia. The show examined Rembrandt Peale's astonishingly rapid technical development in his youth. It also investigated the iconographical meaning of the skull, which is an attribute featured prominently in the Walters’ recently gifted portrait of John Meer.</ExhBoilerText>

        <ExhTitle>Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry from the Walters Art Museum</ExhTitle>
        <ExhBoilerText>The Walters Art Museum is one of few museums in the world that can provide an array of exquisite jewelry from over 5,000 years of world history and from a vast spectrum of cultures. This exhibition of more than 200 highlights from the Walters' collection--many of them never displayed before--presents the evolution of techniques and materials throughout the ages, and demonstrates the importance of jewelry as an expression of creativity, and often wealth and position. A special focus will be placed on finger rings throughout history, with important examples on loan from the distinguished collection of the New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker. 

Bedazzled: 5,000 Years of Jewelry was organized by the Walters Art Museum. The exhibition includes many spectacular pieces from the renowned collection of Benjamin Zucker (New York), which are on loan to the Walters.  Bedazzled is presented by The Women's Committee of the Walters Art Museum with lead support from Betty Cooke, Bill Steinmetz, and The Store Ltd.; Richard S. and Rosalee C. Davison; The Eliasberg Family Foundation; and The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation. Additional support is provided by Bob and Jackie Smelkinson.

Promotional support for Bedazzled is provided by The Baltimore Examiner.</ExhBoilerText>
