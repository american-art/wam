    <PublicDescription>"A strap secured to the back of the board (on which the child rests) passes around the forehead, and the bearer by pressing the lower part with her arms, as represented in this sketch, secures it most effectually and carries it with great ease." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Woodville's familiarity with the distinguished collection of Old Master and contemporary paintings assembled by Robert Gilmor, Jr., of Baltimore, is said to have influenced his decision to become an artist. He left his native Baltimore to study at the Düsseldorf Academy and remained abroad most of his brief career. Woodville, however, occasionally returned to Baltimore for family visits and continued to send pictures to New York to be exhibited at the Art Union. Tragically, he died at the early age of 31, a victim of an overdose of drugs.

In this scene, a young soldier narrates his experiences to an elderly couple. Above them hangs a leg-of-mutton hat, a musket, and a picture-all allusions to the Revolutionary War.

Five years later, the artist developed this composition into Old '76 and Young '48 (Walters 37.2370).

    <PublicDescription>In the summer of 1837, Alfred Jacob Miller accompanied Captain William Drummond Stewart, a veteran of Wellington's Spanish campaign, on an expedition to the American fur-traders' rendezvous held in the Green River Valley. Antoine Clement, the son of an Indian mother and a French-Canadian father, seen here wearing a buckskin tunic, served as a guide. Two years later, Clement accompanied the Scot, now a baronet, back to his ancestral home, Murthly Castle in Scotland. Stewart, who had previously visited Egypt, India, and Turkey, adorned his castle with souvenirs of his travels, including Persian carpets, Turkish hookahs, and weaponry, in addition to Native American artifacts.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In looking at the ruins about Rome, the spectator cannot fail of being sensibly impressed with the old, very old look of the buildings and remains of man's handiwork.  The stones even of which they are compsed seem to be litterally honey-combed with the storms of centuries, that have battled and beat against them.  How different with these Lakes and Mountains;- although they have been in existence thousands of years, what a freshness and newness rests over them,- they are veriably the same yesterday, to-day, and forever to all appearances.  The scene in the sketch presents a broad sheet of water,- and the foreground wild and broken;- with a solitary horseman climbing the hill from the valley below;- lofty promontories flank the sides; carrying the eye to a noble line of mountains in the distance, broken against the sky with spurs &amp; pinnacles." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums.

    <PublicDescription>Miller identified the prototype for this drawing simply as "French School." It could represent a painting by Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803-1860), a French artist who was popularizing "orientalist" subjects during the 1830s.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>After his return to Baltimore in 1842, Miller bought a farm, "Lorraine," on the Franklin Turnpike five miles west of the city. This sketch may have been drawn during a ride between the farm and the city.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"A scene of this kind requires a large body of Indians, and when everything is in readiness (the distant plain being literally black with Buffalo), the 'runners' are called, mounted on fleet horses and well armed, who move cautiously toward the herd, keeping out of sight of the animals by traversing ravines and hollows.  On reaching a proper distance, a signal is given and they all start at once with frightful yells, &amp; commence racing around the herd, drawing their circle closer and closer, until the whol body is huddled together in confusion.  Now they begin firing, and as this throws them into a headlong panic and furious rage, each man selects his animal, wheeling and coursing through the affrighted herd;- the dexterity and grace of the Indians and the thousands upon thousands of Buffalo moving in every direction over an illimitable prairie form a scene altogether, that in the whole world beside, cannot be matched." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Miller illustrates the scene of Prince Charles Edward fleeing after his failed insurrection. As Prince Regent of the exiled house of Stuart, he tried to regain the British throne by uniting Highland clansman and invading England. After his final defeat in 1746, he was chased across Scotland for several months before ultimately escaping to France.

This scene depicts one of his evasions: Flora MacDonald disguises him as an Irish spinning maid named Betty Burke.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>Dolph lived primarily in New York City, he trained with the animal painter Van Kuyck in Antwerp and in Paris from ca. 1868-73. He exhibited at the National Academy of Design and the Paris Salon among other places. He was best known as a painter of cats and dogs, and was referred to as "the American Landseer." He exhibited genre scenes and Hudson River landscapes until 1874 but in 1875 his painting of a Persian cat attracted such great attention that cats and dogs became his focus.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"It is near sunset and the whole camp is very busy, the horses and mules have been driven in, and each man runs towards them as they come, secures his own horse, catches him by the lariat (a rope on the ground from his neck), and leads nim to a good bed of grass, where a picket is driven, and here he is secured for the night, the lariat permitting him to graze to the extent of a circle 25 feet in diameter, and all this is eaten down pretty close by morning.  The grass is quite sufficient without any other provender to keep the animals in good condition, if the work given them to do is not too heavy, or if they are not compedlled to make forced marches.  The selection of the Camp is of so much importance that scouts are sent out previous to the halt of the Caravan, whose duty it is to select sites combining above all things the two great requisites, an abundance of both water &amp; grass." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The North American Indian carries his wonderful stoicism into every transaction of his life,- even the tender subject of selecting a helpmate does not disturb his tranquility - neither is he affected with the slightest romance in regard to the subject.

    <PublicDescription>The artist has portrayed himself at about the age of forty. He has chosen an oval format and has applied the pigments extremely thinly in smooth brush strokes, as was characteristic of many of his mature works. Other self-portraits include a small oil sketch on academy board painted about 1827, a pencil sketch probably made during his western trip in 1837, and a later work showing him as a bearded individual.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"From the right a promontory or bluff projects out boldly into the midst of the Lake throwing a broad reflection into the water,- beyond this the mountains begin to rise until they reach their ultimatum in cold barren peaks of solid rock covered with snow.  Although it was the month of August, we had frequent snow and hail storms, and towards evening thick overcoats were almost indispensable to comfort.  In the morning one or two of the hunters would e dispatched for mountain sheep, or any other game of a size to warrant a shot, for powder and ball are precious articles here and not to be wasted: others would scramble out on the rocks to catch the finny-tribe, not solely for amusement,- no indeed!- keen appetites and insatiable maws were in expectancy, and always ready to do justice to either fish or flesh, with a blazing fire burning briskly, 'in case (as Wilkins Micawber, has it) anything should turn up.' After the meal we could then sit patiently and listen to some Trappers relating reminiscences of his adventures,- his huntings, and fighting with the Indians, and his loves with Indian beauties forming the principal ground work of his narrative." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>In this work, Johnson's last dated painting of everyday life, a group of elderly men, seated around a stove in a cobbler's shop, reminisces about the past. Two years after the picture was completed, Johnson identified the philosophers: Captain Haggerty, the shoemaker; Captain Moore, the talker; and on the left, leaning on his hand, Captain Ray. The other captains, he noted, were by then already deceased.

Like a number of his fellow genre painters, the Boston artist trained abroad in Düsseldorf, Germany, and later at The Hague in the Netherlands, where he became familiar with Dutch 17th-century art. Between 1870 and 1887, Johnson spent the summer and autumn months working in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In this district of the prairie, west of Laramie, and south of the Platte, these monstrous rocks rise immediately from the level plain, attaining altitudes from 500 feet upwards.  They are of all imaginable shapes, as if nature had been in eccentric and merry mood;- taking care however to have the centre of gravity fall is such a manner as to combine the most complete solidity with the utmost strength.  They will be as they are now when the great pyramids of Egypt are forgotten;- with the proviso whoever of 'Ochiltree' in the 'Antiquary,' 'Yemaun keep hands and gunpowther frae them.'  Of what possible use can they be? With a telescope you can see the mountain sheep looking complacently on us,- they scale these dizzy heights with ease and defy us to follow,- this is the use to them.  At night (if they discover no enemy near) the flock descends for food and drink, and by daylight return to the tops of thes impregnable forts, where they sleep secure.  Trappers state that when two males from opposite directions meet on a narrow ledge of rock neither make way, but give battle and continue it, until one or the other is thrown down."   A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums.

    <PublicDescription>In about 1830, Elliott moved from upstate New York to Manhattan, where he studied briefly with John Quidor (1801-81), a specialist in literary scenes. Otherwise, he was largely self-taught, although he had thoroughly familiarized himself with the techniques employed by the portrait painter Gilbert Stuart (1755-1828). By the 1850s, Elliott had become the leading portraitist in New York.

Asher B. Durand (1796-1886) began his career as an engraver but eventually turned to landscape painting and succeeded Thomas Cole as the leader of the Hudson River school of landscape painters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>In the 1840s Eastman Johnson studied in Düsseldorf, Germany, with Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze. Johnson also studied the work of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish masters in The Hague before ending his European travels in Paris, studying with the academic painter Thomas Couture in 1855. He spent the rest of his career in America. He is best known for his genre scenes and portraits.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>South Pass, or the Continental Divide, was the gateway to Oregon and California.  The southwestern desert was not yet as fully explored as the Midwest, and so the trail along the Platte became the favored route.  Discovered in 1812, the pass remained unknown to Anglo-Americans until a group of Crow Indians told Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick about it in 1824.  After William H. Ashley started the rendezvous system in 1825, Fitzpatrick and others used South Pass as the entrance to the best beaver country in the mountains.

Here Miller pictures the frenzy that possessed the men as they neared the fresh water.  The Indians, watching in contempt, Miller suggested, had much the same attitude as did Captain Stewart, who would not run his horse for the water but walked casually along as if he did not feel the same thirst that possessed the men.

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>One of the greatest events in the Plains Indians' life was the buffalo hunt. Few Indian women tried to conquer all the skills necessary for the buffalo hunt, and no wonder. Fascinated with buffalo, as were all artists who went west, Miller enumerated them all: "No sooner does she reach the animal than she must watch his every movement, keep an eye to her horse and guide him, must look out for rifts and Buffalo wallows on the prairie, guard against the animal's forming an angle and goring, manage bow and arrows, or lance, and while both are at full speed to wound him in a virtal part; to do all this requires great presence of mind, dexterity, and courage, and few women are found amongst them willing to undertake or capable of performing it." 

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums.

    <PublicDescription>Miller erroneously recalled the prototype for this view of Venice as being a painting by Jacob van Ruisdael. However, it is a copy after The Stonemason's Yard by Canaletto, which is now in the National Gallery, London.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"In the foreground of the sketch, the principal figure is a female sustaining her child by a fillet around the brow;- this is the mode practiced when she walks.  In riding out the child is hung to the saddle bow.  When she is engaged in any domestic emplyment, it is suspended from the branch of a tree, or on the tripod near the lodge.  In the backgrund, the inevitable calumet is being smoked,- the violation of a friendship formed by the pipe is deemed infamous among the Indians, and hence it is of the utmost importance to join in this ceremony.  It is used on some occasions as a religious observance - by it they declare war &amp; secure peace, invoking the sun and moon as witnesses to their sincerity.  It is also soemtimes sent on long journeys to parties with whom they wish to form treaties.  In all cases it is regarded as a solemn oath and sacred engagement." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The artist whom Miller most frequently copied while visiting the Louvre was Rembrandt. He undoubtedly was attracted by the dramatic contrast between light and shadow appearing in "The Philosopher in Meditation", the Rembrandt painting that is the subject of this drawing. 

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"The government of a band of this kind is somewhat despotic, being composed of a heterogeneous mass of people from all sections, free and comp trappers, traders, half-breeds, and Indians.  Our leader was admirably calculated for it, as he understood well the management of unruly spirits.  He had served under Wellington in the Peninsular Campaigns, and at the battle of Waterloo,- indeed seemed to be in a measure composed of the same iron that formed "Great Duke" himself." A.J.

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch illustrates an incident of two mountain Trappers, found near Independence Rock, in a starving condition.  On the Caravan's reaching them, it was discovered that their ammunition was completely exhausted,- but on that morning one of them had succeeded in killing two rattle snakes, which were in the process of cooking on the fire.  Our Captain's question to them was, 'Good God! how can you eat such disguesting food?' One of them answered 'This child doe'st savez what disgustin' is' - Wagh! In consideration of their weak state, a soup was first prepared for them, which they ate with a will.  This was followed by some bottled porter- and then came the substantials in the shape of humpribs &amp;c.  On parting with them, our Captain presented each with a horse, a supply of powder and shot, &amp; a blanket, sending them on their way rejoicing, and with an equipment better than ever." A.J.

    <PublicDescription>Boughton spent most of his career in England but owed much of his financial success to works aimed at the American market. He was particularly well known for Puritan subjects drawn from popular and literary sources. Late in his career, he furnished illustrations for editions of Washington Irving's "Rip van Winkle and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow" (published in 1907) and Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter" (published in 1908). While the subject of "The Fairy Tale" is story-telling itself rather than any particular work of literature, its style relates closely to these late works.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This drawing in pastel and two accompanying works (WAM 37.2584 and WAM 37.2585) in pencil and gouache were made by the artist in preparation for a painting showing a regatta held on the Grand Canal in May, 1902.

Smith was born on St. Paul Street, Baltimore. He trained initially as an engineer but later taught himself to paint in watercolors. He traveled extensively, producing watercolors which were reproduced in deluxe "travel books," such as "Gondola Days" (1897) and "The Venice of To-Day" (1897) as well as various magazines. He was also the author of many popular books.

    <PublicDescription>The detailed rendering of this tranquil scene is characteristic of Hart's early work, when he was most deeply influenced by the Hudson River school of landscape painting. 

Born in Scotland, Hart began his career as a coach decorator. In 1850, he traveled to Germany's major art centers--Munich and Düsseldorf--where he completed his training as an artist. From 1857 until his death, Hart was based in New York City.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The Trappers are here being pursued by Indians, or as they style it- 'the varmits are on their tracts.' To baffle them and throw them out, they use all manners of stratagems,- kept so long that it becomes as tough as sole leather; and lastly entering streams or rivers and fording them up or down as the exigencies of the case may require,- for when they are transporting valuable packages of goods,- one of the most prominent being that they must lose either by victory or defeat." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In the immediate foreground are groups of Mountain Fir, Pines, and other hardy trees.  To the right bold promontories from the bosom of the Lake, consisting of rock interspersed with a growth of stunted trees,- beyond these and at the upper part of the Lake ranges of mountains rise, one above the other, terminating ultimately in pyramidal peaks.  In viewing them, the first comparison that strikes the observer is that of a stormy sea, suddenly arrested and congealed into snow and ice - being thus transfixed forever.  Atmospheric effects combined with the light of the sun change their appearance through the day. In the morning they glitter like frosted silver, while under a warm sunset they partake of a rosey tint;- during a storm they have a dark and forbidden aspect, but at mid-day under a clear sky, they are 'robed in an azure hue';- under any light however they are wondrous and sublime;- Cold and pulseless must be the heart of him who can view such a scene with indifference - verily he is not to be envied." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Henry Inman was America's premier portrait painter during the 1830s. He trained in New York City with the then-renowned painter John Wesley Jarvis. The artist went on to become one of the foremost members of the "Knickerbocker" circle, and together with Samuel F. B. Morse, the painter and later telegraph magnate, he founded the National Academy of Design. Subsequently Inman was much sought after as a portraitist by society figures in New York City and Philadelphia, until his early death in 1846.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Thomas Charles Farrer was born in London and trained at the Working Men's College, where from 1854 to 1858 John Ruskin taught elementary classes. Farrer embraced Ruskin's teaching and on his arrival in New York, in ca. 1857, championed his former teacher's ideas. This drawing shows Ruskin's influence in the close observation of nature and meticulous detailing.

This drawing is mounted on separate sheet of paper. Around the drawing is a border, and beneath it an inscription in red ink. It was likely originally in one of William T. Walters' two albums of American drawings (see entry for 37. 1954) and therefore was likely acquired in ca. 1859.

Ramage worked mainly in New York, from the late 1770s and quickly became the leading portrait-miniaturist in that city. Among his most distinguished sitters were George Washington and George Clinton, govenor of New York. His works are often framed with characteristic scalloped shaped and engraved housings. Ramage's work desk with tools and artist samples can be found at the New York Historical Society.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"The scene represents a Trapper taking a wife, or purchasing one. The prices varying in accordance with circumstance. He (the trapper) is seated with his friend, to the left of the sketch, his hand extended to his promised wife, supported by her father and accompanied by a chief, who holds the calumet, and article indispensable in all grand ceremonies. ... A Free Trapper (white of half-breed), being ton or upper circle, is a most desirable match, but it is conceded that he is a ruined man after such an investment, the lady running into unheard of extravagancies. She wants a dress, horse, gorgeous saddle, trappings, and the deuce knows what besides. For this the poor devil trapper sells himself, body and soul, to the Fur Company for a number of years. He traps beaver, hunts the Buffalo and bear, Elk and etc. The fur and robes of which the Company credit to his account." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In this pen and ink sketch the artist depicts a young cadet at a luxurious picnic surrounded by elegant young women. The viewer is left wondering if this scene is a fantasy, a recollection of a real event, or an ironic commentary on West Point military training? This drawing was previously attributed to Whistler, who made many drawings, sometimes in the margins of his text books, while a cadet at West Point between 1851 and 1854. However, Whistler's fellow cadets also often sketched humorous scenes to pass the time. This drawing is now attributed to one of Whistler's peers, Francis Laurens Vinton (1835-1879) (who graduated from West Point in 1856). He was later a brigadier general on the side of the Union during the Civil War, and after the war a founding Professor of the School of Mining at Columbia College, New York.  In the 1909 "Life of James McNeill Whistler" by E.R. and J. Pennell, Vinton is mentioned as having known Whistler in Paris during his student days (see note page 55).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Maurits Frederik Hendrik de Haas was born in Rotterdam in 1832. He studied there at the Academy of Fine Arts and also with Louis Meyer in The Hague, where he served as Artist to the Dutch Navy. In 1859 the artist came to New York. He painted a number of naval scenes for Admiral Farragut during the Civil War and also gained a reputation for his coastal scenes, exhibiting at the Boston Athenaeum, the National Academy, and the Maryland Historical Society. He was elected Associate of the National Academy in 1863 and Academician in 1867, and was one of the original members of the American Society of Painters in Water-colors in 1866. This coastal scene shows several small sailing ships and depicts the hazy atmosphere and reflections of the sun on the water.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Blauvelt studied with Charles Loring Elliott and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. He pursued a career as a genre and portrait painter, before settling in Annapolis, Maryland where he taught draftsmanship at the Naval Academy. Blauvelt was among the artists whom William T. Walters encountered during his forays in the New York art market just prior to the Civil War, acquiring 5 works by the artist. Blauvelt specialized in small genre paintings, frequently of single figures.

Showing a young boy standing in front of an open stove, this painting can be read as a more innocent pendent to WAM 37.1950, which shows an elderly carter warming up by drinking what is presumably an alcoholic beverage.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"About 22 years of age, son of the Chief Ma-wo-ma. This Indian was an admirable specimen of the Snakes. His form, - straight as an arrow, and a carriage of natural grace, - that no dancing master could impart. It was impossible to look at him without admiration. ... His bearing was that of a prince - courageous and self-reliant."
A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The son of a miniaturist, Baker spent almost his whole life in New York City, except for a trip to Italy in around 1846. He studied at the National Academy of Design. He was one of the most sought after portraitists of his time, but also painted ideal pieces, such as "Love at First Sight," and "The May Queen" (present location unknown). The Walters Art Museum owns 8 works by this artist; his works can also be found at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

This self-portrait of the artist was acquired by William T. Walters during the artist's lifetime, and he seems to have found favor with the collector. He also portrayed Mrs. Ellen Harper Walters, William's wife, and their daughter, Jennie (see WAM 37.2637 and WAM 37.1207).

The plait of hair on the back, surrounded a blue enamel field, is light brown. Since the sitter is shown with powdered hair, this perhaps belongs to another person.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"American sculptors travel thousands of miles to study Greek statues in the Vatican at Rome, seemingly unaware that in their own country there exists a race of men equal in form and grace (if not superior) to the finest beau ideal ever dreamed of by the Greeks.  And it does seem a little extraordinary that up to this time (as far as I am aware) not a single sculptor has thought it worth his while to make a journey among these Indians, who are now sojourning on the Western side of the Rocky mountains, and are rapidly passing away.  Most unquestionably, that sculptor who travels here,- and models fro what he sees (supposing him to have equal power and genius), will far excel any other who merely depends upon his own conception of what it ought to be. The subject of the sketch is an Indian's home;- he has planted his lodge on the borders of a small stream, screened from the prairie by hills in the middle distance, near which are some of his party." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The Sioux's recommendation (who wishes to officiate as a guide) is here being read by our Captain.  The Indians in their intercourse with the whites have had sagacity to discover the value of certificates of good character, and procure such testimonials from those whom they have served in order to recommend themselves to others; preserving these papers with great care.  It sometimes happens that the writer (knowing that the poor savage cannot read) gives him a character not at all favorable, in short, tells too much." A.J.

    <PublicDescription>This arcadian scene perhaps had a Christian message as a church spire is seen in the landscape in the backgroud. In common with other pre-Civil War images of the United States, America is depicted a kind of "promised land" of virtue.

Part of the Hudson River School, Casilear was born in New York and trained with Asher B. Durand at a time when he was an engraver. By the middle 1850s he had entirely ceased his work as an engraver, in favor of painting full-time. He was elected a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1851, having been an associate member since 1831, and exhibited his works there for over fifty years.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This locket contains two portrait miniatures, one of Mrs. Walter Clarke and the other of her infant son, Marvia H. Clarke, who holds a rattle. Mrs. Clarke appears bust-length with brown hair, wearing a wine red dress. The child is seated wearing a white dress, holding a rattle and surrounded by clouds. The clouds might indicate that this is a posthumous portrait. From the sitter's center-parted hair style and off the shoulder dress the miniature appears to date from ca. 1840.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This ink drawing is a "holograph"- a document written entirely by the hand of the person whose signature it bears. With words and images all supplied by the same pen, holographs represented a particular claim to authenticity. These were sought after in the first half of the 19th century by collectors who would assemble them into albums. This holograph is likely to have come into the Walters' collection from that of another Baltimore collector, Robert Gilmor. The interest of this sketch for its original owner would have been underlined by the inscription indicating that the holograph was executed at West's famous residence and gallery in Newman Street, London.

The allegorical drawing depicts a seated female figure to the left gesturing to the right, representing America, while a group of youths at the center are being lead by the male figure of Genius, who also gestures right toward two classical buildings labeled "Virtue" and "Honor." This holograph evokes sentiments similar to another in the Walters collection of the almost the same date by Morse (WAM 37.1536).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"One of the greatest privations to be combatted on the pairies is the want of water. The Trapper leaves his camp in the morning, and after traveling all day under the hot sun, his tongue parched and swollen, and almost cleaving to the roof of his mouth: - you may fancy, under such circumstances with what delight he hails at a distance, the life-giving stream. The subject of the sketch is an Indian girl supplying an exhausted Trapper with a draught of water, which she has brought in a buffalo horn. To fully appreciate the boon, one must go through the ordeal, by being subjected to the privation, - it is impossible otherwise." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This oval miniature of a Confederate officer is enclosed in an imported gold Italian frame decorated with a band of beading and an applied band of braiding. This miniature was once thought to be General Thomas Jonathan Jackson (Stonewall Jackson) (1824-1863), but the sitter lacks Jackson's blue eyes, and there are discrepences in the uniform he wears (for example a general's buttons would have been decorated with eagles).

Brown was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and studied painting with Arthur Armstrong, a fine-art, sign, and "fancy" painter. At the age of 21, Brown set up his own business in Lancaster and also taught himself miniature painting. He combined the look of new photographic processes with the colors and composition of oil painting, often basing his portraits on daguerreotypes and later ambrotypes. This miniature has the appearance of being after a photograph. Brown exhibited frequently at the Pennsylvania Academy until 1864 when he joined the photography practice of Frederick Augustus Wenderoth and W. Curtis Taylor, which became the firm of Wenderoth, Taylor, Brown. Brown tinted photographs in the era before color photography, a skill that was in demand in order to create accurate colored likenesses. However, Brown did not completely abandon miniature painting, as this was a practice still in demand among elite clients. In 1876 Brown received a medal for his miniatures at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).  This sketch comes from a Vernon Miller Family Album.

    <PublicDescription>"We had several opportunies while encamped at the Rendezvous on Green River (where some 3,000 Indians were met together) of attending their Councils.  Old men generally officiated as speakers, while before them sat the sages and warriors, generally in squatting positions, interspersed with chiefs on horseback, every one as rigid as the statue of the Commendatore in 'Don Giovanni.' Each had his turn to harangue amid the most profound silence; and such sentences as were translated to me were short, pithy apothegms, mixed up with considerable boasting. 'Their enemies were cowards - serpents with forked tongues (parliamentary for liars), cheats, &amp;c.'  With a compliment to their own nation, - their wish to be at peace, and to bury the hatchet, one orator would conclude, and the next take the parole.  History has preserved many eloquent speeches of the Indians,- the one taking precedence is that said to have been delivered to Lord Dunmore by Logan, a Shawanese Chief;- it will be found in 'Jefferson's notes on Virginia.'"

    <PublicDescription>Perry trained in Europe, initially under Emmanuel Leutze in Düsseldorf, Germany, and then with Thomas Couture in Paris. Before opening a studio in New York in 1866, he traveled extensively and for a time served as United States Consul in Venice.

This drawing was made during an 1858-1862 stay in the United States and records a typical kitchen interior in mid 19th-century America. The sentimental young cook strokes the soft feathers of a bird. The bird's eye is open, unlike the eyes of the birds placed on the table. Is the young girl bidding the bird farewell before she has to kill it?

    <PublicDescription>"At rare intervals females take the field in pursuit of game or catching horses.  They are not well adapted to this service, but either through a frolic or at the command of that inexorable mother necessity, she tries her hand.  The saddle on which she rides is so constructed that she cannot readily fall, it is a high demipique, the pommel being near two feet high, to this, she fastens one end of the 'lariat,'- the other end is coiled with the noose in her hand.  The sketch represents her in the act of throwing the lariat, and from inexperience, she makes severl ineffectual throws, before the intention is accomplished.  The fact of her requiring a saddle, however, fixes on her an indelible disgrace in the eyes of the male Indian,- who regards such effeminacy with contempt."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Strother, a native of Martinsburg, Virginia (now West Virginia), trained in New York and later in France and Italy. Returning to America in 1844, he spent a winter in Baltimore, and then settled in Martinsburg. Strother specialized in illustrations for books and magazines, most notably "Harper's Monthly."

This example is believed to show the artist's first wife Anne seated at a piano in the Strother family's hotel in Berkeley Springs. It served as a basis for a wood-engraving appearing in John Esten Cooke's novel, "Ellie," or, "The Human Comedy," Richmond, 1855.

    <PublicDescription>"The scene of the sketch is on the Platte," wrote Miller, "at night the Buffalo come to the River banks in legions, to quench thirst and refresh themselves by swimming." Miller, like all other artists to visit the West, was amazed at the buffaloes and recorded many details of their activities: "Two things are essential to the well-being and comfort of this animal- he must have his water bath, which he usually takes at night, and his earth bath, with which he solaces himself during the day." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The woman in front has her papoose. It is hung to the saddle bow by a strip of buckskin. The child is attached to the board and secured by buckskin highly ornamented and laced in front. If any one thing gives an Indian woman pleasure, above another, it must be the elaboration of this affair. Porcupine quills stained with all manner of colours, quite indelible, and of beautiful patterns, are carried down and across the front; now if she can procure some small bells to fasten on the guard piece of the head, the arrangement is almost complete."

    <PublicDescription>Inspired by German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, who explored Latin America at the end of the 18th century, Church traveled widely in search of romantic subjects, visiting South America in 1853 and 1857. Sketches of the spectacular tropical scenery made during his second voyage to Ecuador and Colombia served as the basis for this well-known painting, which was frequently reproduced as a print.

William T. Walters purchased this painting in 1858. It was sold at auction at the National Academy of Design in New York, for the benefit of the widow and children of William Ranney, genre painter. Walters paid $555 for this small painting, the highest price achieved at the sale.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"When a tribe has a grievance either through loss of any of their men, or of depredations committed against them, the chiefs summon their young warriors, arm, dress, and paint themselves elaborately and set out on the war path.  All this threatens mischief, and it is by no means a pleasant thing to meet them under such circumstances, unless you have an able escort.  Revenge (one of the strongest passions of an Indian) is a powerful incentive, blinding their reason and exciting their savage appetite for blood." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Charles Fraser was a painter of miniatures, portraits in oils and landscapes. He spent most of his life in his native city of Charleston depicting its leading citizens. The subject of this miniature is Elizabeth Sarah Faber (1825-1882). She was the daughter of Henry F. Faber and Sarah Faber (née Seabrook) of Charleston, South Carolina. Her father was a rice planter who lived near Adams Run. We know from the artist's account book, in which he recorded his sitters and the sums received for each portrait, that this miniature was completed in January 1846 and cost $38 (see entry on page 27). In 1846 the sitter was 21 years old. That year was significant for Elizabeth as she came of age and received the significant sum of $6000 from her grandfather's (Thomas Bannister Seabrook's) will, drawn up in 1827, but which came into effect on his death on 19 April 1839. In June 1852 Elizabeth married Berkley Grimball Wilkins. (This information is taken from "The South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine," Vol. 17, p. 19.)
This miniature was also shown in a solo exhibition in honor of the artist in 1857 in Charleston (see "Catalogue of the Fraser Gallery," no. 115). A miniature of her father dating from 1837 was also shown in this exhibition (no. 114). The case recalls those made for daguerreotype photographs, although in fact these were adapted from traveling cases for miniatures.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In approaching our destination, one morning as we proceeded quietly along, our ears were saluted by sounds that raised the pulse immediately, and to which we had become sensitively alive.  It was a tremendous Indian yell of a large body of men, and we heard the clattering of their horses as they came down the valley;- as soon however as we had sight of them, we were relieved;- it was a body of Trappers, who had heard of our approach and sallied forth to give us a greeting;- this is done by a feu de joie of blank cartridges and a hearty shaking of hands among the merry fellows;- for they found many of their comrades in our company, and when we encamped for the evening, our Captain gave them a grand Carouse in the shape of hump ribs, buffalo tongues, and mountain sheep.  In addition to this, a metheglin, made of honey and alcohol, potent and fiery, was concocted and circulated among them."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"An old trapper is up on his feet spinning a yarn wherein he is giving an account of an adventure of Markhead's with a grizzly bear.  According to his account, Markhead was afraid of nothing on or under this earth, and 'was bound to shine in the biggest sort of a crowd.' The story, stripped of the trapper's ornamentation, was to this effect:- That Markhead for a wager determined to go into some wild cherry bushes where the bear was known to be, and dispatch him simply with a tomahawk.  In this affair, the 'B'ar' was too much for him.  In approaching him through the bushes, he was not aware that Bruin was so near, and in a moment the powerful brute had his paw on our hero's head, tearing away the entire scalp.  Most wonderful of all in the course of time, the trapper entirely recovered, and when we reached the Rendezvous in Oregon, we saw him well and hearty; his head having little or no hair on it and presenting a very singular appearance."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch represents 'our mess' at the morning meal;- Jean whi is pouring out coffee, seems to our hungry eyes more graceful than Hebe disposing Nectar, although he is more shapeless than a log of wood.  The plate service of the table is of capital tin ware, partout, and the etiquette rigid in some particulars;- for instance, nothing in the shape of a fork must be used.  With a 'Bowie' you separate a large rib from the mass before you, hold firmly to the smaller end, and your outrageous appetite teaches all the rest.  The usual mode of sitting is cross-legged like a Turk.  Indians are looking on patiently, in order to be ready for the 2nd table."  A.J.

    <PublicDescription>For years, Bannister painted landscapes with muted colors that recalled the works of the French Barbizon school so popular among New England collectors during the second half of the 19th century. However, in one of his last works, which he painted during a stay in Boston in the late 1890s, Bannister adopted a much more vivid palette. 

Bannister, the son of a black immigrant from Barbados and his Scottish-Canadian wife, was born in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada. Initially a seaman, he settled in Boston, where he eked out a living as a hairdresser and as a hand-tinter of photographs. With the encouragement of his wife, he turned to painting and for a while shared a studio with Edwin Lord Weeks. His atmospheric landscapes found a ready market, especially in Boston. At the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876, Bannister received a first-place medal. He was the first African-American artist to win a national award, but the judges were surprised by his ethnic background. Bannister resided in Providence, Rhode Island, where he became one of the seven founding members of the Providence Art Club, an institution that still flourishes today.

    <PublicDescription>This tailpiece was specially commissioned for one of William T. Walters' albums of drawings. It shows a palette and brushes covered by a spider's web, the spider is suspended from a brush below. Under this is the word "finis," Latin for "end." The seemingly abandoned pallette perhaps suggests the mortality of the artist. This would echo a second tailpiece by the same artist which shows a skull, and is inscribed "emigravit," meaning "departed."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"While sketching this wild scene, we observed our Commander and a mountaineer riding round to various points, and to our question when he returned, 'Whether he inteded to cross?' he answered 'Yes.' Not the slightest necessity existed for this (except that river looked a little in opposition), as we had to return again:- but this willfulness on the part of the torrent settled the question.  As my companion P--- had been drowned in a similar crossing, the prospect was not overpleasant.  In a little time the mountaineer called out to us, 'Allons nous en - mes amis! J'ai la trouvé la place.' We rejoined him &amp; in he plunged.  The water rushed with such force that, although it was near his arm pit on one side, it was below his knee on the other, at the same time drifting him down the river, but we saw him reach the opposite shore in safety." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"With the aid of two or three of the hunters the Buffalo is raised from his fallen position and places in a sitting posture, in order to take that most superlative morceaux, the "Hump rib." A cut is made longitudinally with a knife, the skin on each side flapped down on the shoulder,- and a trapper to the right in the sketch is receiveing a tomahawk in order to separate the spinal process.  After this valuable piece is secured, the fleece and side ribes follow, and the balance, if there is no pressure in the camp, is left for the expectant wolves, who appear to claim it as their perquisite, and often are sitting at a distance watching their interests in the matter.  The horse to the left is new to the business and is alarmed at the smell of blood and carnage.  Directly in front of him is a Sumpter mule, equipped to bear the meat to camp."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"The hunter has singled out and disengaged from the main body of the Buffalo his reference, and is now running, and about to shoot him.  While others are in hot pursuit of the retreating band, on the rise of the hill,- these hills militate against the speed of the animal, as their great weight in front soon tires them down.  The Pawnees are slaughtering them mainly for their furs.  The robes they manufacture are for the market, and they show great skills and considerable taste comparatively  in ornamenting them in colors.  Women are chiefly engaged in tanning the inner side of the robes, and are adepts in giving softness and pliability to the skin:- the larger ones are generally prepared in halves and sewed together, very neatly at the centre.  When ready they are packed in bundles of about a dozen, and conveyed to the Forts, or stations for trading, nearest to their camp." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"Among the wild animals of the West, none gave us so much pleasure, or caused such excitement, as the bands of wild horses that at intervals came under our view.  The beauty and symmetry of their forms, their wild and spirited action,- long full sweeping manes and tails - variety of color, and fleetness of motion,- all combined to call forth admiration from the most stoical.  One of the greatest difficulties we experienced was to get near enough.  They fought shy and held us at a long range,- shewing that they were prudent and sensible, in addition to other fine qualities;- often we had to resort to a telescope.  The wheel like trained columns of cavalry, charge, scatter, and form again;- again they are seen in battalions scampering across the prairie, stopping for a moment,- snuffing the breeze,- taking a final look at the intruders from the last undulation, and are gone.  The sketch will convey to the observer some idea of this glorious scene,- but it is almost impossible to catch such magic convolutions and secure the spirit of such evanescent forms under the excitement and difficulties that may be readily imagined to transpire at the moment."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In 1880 Remington went West, sending sketches of Western life back to Eastern newspapers. In 1886 he came back East and began painting. In 1894 he turned to modeling for bronze sculpture and was thrilled with the results: "My watercolors will fade but I will endure in bronze."
	
Remington's vision of a great Plains Indian brave in a moment of tensed exertion as he enters the fray, spear held high, is riveting. The horse and rider seems to float, the buffalo hide trailing behind. While there is one best view, every side merits attention. The gestures of the man and the movement of the horse "suppose" an adversary and a prairie. The work is surprisingly self-sufficient; one does not wonder about the landscape.
	
While Remington initially used sand casting, this is the first bronze to be cast by the lost wax process; the results are visible in the evocative texture of the buffalo robe.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Among these wandering tribes 'eternal vigilance is the price of safety.'  During our whole journey, scarcely a day passed that we were not conscious of being under the surveillance of unseen eyes.  From the tops of bluffs, on the prairie lying in the long grass, behind trees, and in the midst of bushes, our every movement was noted and reported at headquarters.  In civilized life we appreciated the industry of that active person Mrs. Grundy, but in the matter of inquisitiveness our North American Indians surpass her,- the motive is different however."   A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The curious circle represented in the sketch we found on the upper waters of the Platte, near our encampment for the night, and puzzled ourselves sufficiently in surmises touching their original and import.  They formed nearly complete circles of about 20 feet diameter, composed of Buffalo skulls, with noses pointed each to the centre.  We were informed by the Trappers and old mountain voyageurs of their having met with them in other districts, composed entirely of human skulls;- but could give us no further information as to their purpose.  The word 'medicine' being equivalent in meaning to our word 'charm.'  It is more than probable that they formed some part of a superstitious ceremony." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Waist-length portrait of Charles Smith Gilmor (1817-1866) of Baltimore, with brown hair and close-cropped beard, blue eyes, wearing a black coat with black velvet collar, dark green vest showing slightly, and a white shirt with a brown and white bow tie. 

Charles Smith Gilmor was the eighth son of William Gilmor. He was likely closely related to Robert Gilmor, the prominent Baltimore merchant and art collector. Charles also seems to have had an art collection, which included Old Masters and at least one contemporary work by William Sidney Mount, transferred to him by Robert. A Charles Gilmor is listed in the 1860 Baltimore city directory as Baltimore County's coal agent. Charles appears to have married twice, secondly to Charlotte Patterson (Christened 1820 in Baltimore) in 1839. Her parents are listed as Charlotte Nichols and Joseph Patterson, a wealthy iron merchant and importer who was elected president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1837. She appears to have moved in the same social circles as the Gilmor's. A portrait of her dated to ca. 1840-45 can be found in the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT (1976.12.3). It is approximately the same size as this miniature, and a section of the background is a very similar color. In addition the paint in some sections of both miniature has become translucent. The Yale miniature is likely in its original travaling case, whereas the Walters' portrait has been reworked for hanging. Husband and wife look in opposite directions, and therefore when the portraits were placed together with the husband on the left and the wife on the right would have looked towards one another.

George Lethbridge Saunders was born in Bristol, England. The facts of his life are sparse. He exhibited in London between 1829 and 1839 and subsequently in 1851 and 1853. Evidence suggests Saunders spent the decade of the 1840s in the United States, where he exhibited works at the Apollo Art Association and at the Artists' Fund Society in Philadelphia. He is also known to have worked in Baltimore, Savannah and Charleston. After his return to England, little is known of his life or career. He died in Bristol in 1863.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York own several works by Saunders, including one with an inscription giving the location as Baltimore and the date as 1841, it is therefore possible that both the Walters and Yale portraits date from around that time, which was close to Charles Smith Gilmor's marriage to Charlotte Patterson in 1839.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The scene depicts one of the crossings, and not a favorable one.  The water is deep and Bull boats must be resorted to.  The Trapper in the foreground looking back at the approaching Caravan is waiting for orders, while others are testing the depth of the river by swimming across with faint hopes of any fording that will answer so as to avoid the construction of boats.  The preparation of the latter loses much time,- sufficient Buffalo must be killed at once to furnish the hides, and while one party is in search of these, another is removing the goods from the larger wagons and taking the bodies from the wheels;- hides are sewed and streched over them, and the contents of all the other vehicles transferred,- the boats are then floated over by the men wading and swimming along-side.  Canadian Trappers display wonderful good nature on such occasions, singing their simple French songs;- but when any fighting is to be done, the Kentuckian and Missourian take precedence by long odds." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length portrait of John Whipple, with brown hair wearing a black coat, black waistcoat, white shirt and black cravat. John married Maria Bowen (1772-1836), his first wife, with whom he had seven children. One of whom, Harriet, is depicted by the same artist in WAM 38.478. John decended from one of the first settlers of Rhode Island.

Born in Leeds, England, and trained in an architect's office, Richard Morrell Staigg came to the United States in 1831. Washington Allston encouraged him and he soon devoted himself to miniature painting. He was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy of Design, New York City, of which he was elected an associate in 1856, and an academician in 1861. In the last two decades of his life he devoted himself to portraits, landscapes and genre scenes in oil.

    <PublicDescription>Although Miller recalled "The Good Samaritan" as being by the 17th-century Dutch artist, Philips Wouvermans, it was, in fact, regarded as a work by Rembrandt.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"The head of this grim chief almost shadows forth his character,- fierce and impetuous in his passion, he recognized no law but his own will. With Indian craft, he befriended the Whites, knowing that he would gain advantages thereby. In calling his people to counsel he would listen to them-state his own opinion, and follow it.- they would not dare to question his imperious will.

A subsequent traveller to the Rocky Mountains thus described his death. "Numerous Indians were with the Fur Co's men,- 'Mantau-Tathonca' was also there with a few of his people. As he lay in his lodge, a fray arose between his adherents and the kinsman of his enemy. The war-whoop was raised, bullets and arrows began to fly, and the camp was in confusion. The chief sprang up, and in a fury from the lodge shouted to the combatants on both sides to cease.  Instantly (for the attack was preconcerted) came the reports of two or three guns, and the twanging of a dozen bows,- and the savage hero, mortally wounded, pitched forward headlong to the ground.  The tumult became general, and was not quelled until several had fallen on both sides."

    <PublicDescription>Edmonia Lewis was the first African American sculptor to receive international recognition. Born in Greenbush, New York, to a Haitian father of African descent and a mother of Native American and African American descent, Lewis spent a brief time in Boston studying with the sculptor Edward Brackett. In 1866, she moved from Boston to Rome, Italy, to study sculpture and to escape racial discrimination. Lewis adopted the prevailing Neoclassical style of sculpture but softened it with a degree of naturalism. She had a successful career specializing in biblical subjects, themes recalling her Native American and African American ancestry, and portrait busts of important people.

This portrait bust of Diocletian Lewis (1823–86), was made in the artist's Rome studio. Dio Lewis (no relation) who trained in medicine at Harvard College's medical department and practiced briefly in Buffalo, New York, is remembered chiefly for lectures and publications dealing with preventive medicine and physical hygiene, as well as for his support of liberal causes, including women's rights.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The most favorable time to view these Lakes (to an artist especially) was early in the morning or towards sunset;- at these times one side or the other would be thrown into deep purple masses, throwing great broad shadows, with sharp light glittering on the extreme tops,- while the opposite mountains received its full complement of awrm, mellow &amp; subdued light;- thus forming a chiaro obscuro and contrast most essential to the picturesque in color:- an attempt has been made to reach this in the sketch.  This was the only lake we saw that had an island;- the scene in reality was charming, but would have required the pencil of Satnfield, Turner, or Church in giving it due effect and rendering it complete justice.  Patiently it awaits the coming man." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>While copying in the Louvre, Miller was attracted to a painting showing a man drawing a sword. At the time, this picture was thought to be by the Venetian master Giorgione (1478 (?)-1511), and to represent Pierre Terrail Bayard, the renowned, early 16th-century French knight and national hero who is remembered as "le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche" (the knight without fear and beyond reproach). The Louvre picture is now attributed to Pietro de Muttoni, known as Pietro della Vecchia (1605-1678).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"It is near the close of day, and the sun is throwing a warm glow over the distant hills. The group represented in the sketch is simply some Indians seated near their camp fire, talking and smoking, while preparations are busily going forward for a feast. A warrior chief has just dismounted from his horse, returning from hunting, or something worse, and the inevitable pipe is ready for him. The scene would appear almost Arcadian, if we did not know that a sudden war whoop would rouse instantly the demon within them, and change altogether the aspect of things. In a state of quietude, they are merely sleeping volcanoes liable to break forth at any moment; the slightest provocation converting the fair scene into one of carnage and desolation." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"The location of the scene is Horse-shoe Creek, with a group of Indians refreshing their horses, the riders are armed with the bow, spear, and target;- being toujous pret.  They are justified in this, when probably the first party they happen to meet of a different tribe will be also armed to the teeth and provoke them to combat.  Nearly all tribes have their nom de guerre- thus the Camanche represent themselves by a waving motion of the hand, signifying the crawling of a snake.  Cheyennes- (cut arms) signified by a feint with a knife across the arm.- Arapahos (smellers) sign made by taking hold if the nose.- Sioux (cut throats) sing made by drawing hand across the throat;- Pawnees (wolves) sign made by placing a hand on each side of the forehead, with two fingers pointing front.- and Crows by imitating the flapping of birds'-wings with the hands." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Mounted on the lid of this burl walnut snuffbox are a silver plate and thumbpiece. The plate, which bears the mark of the famous Boston silversmith Jacob Hurd, has been engraved with the Cooper family crest and the letters WC, the monograms of both William Cooper (1694-1743) and of his son of the same name (1721-1809). Samuel Cooper, a member of the next generation of Coopers and possibly an owner of this box, is reported "to have sacrificed his life to the inordinate use of Scotch snuff."

    <PublicDescription>Waist-length portrait of Governor William Charles Coles Claiborne (ca. 1772-1817), with light brown hair, wearing an officer's coat of blue with deep white lapels and high collar, gold buttons, gold epaulettes, white shoulder belt across chest with insignia in center, high black collar and white muslin jabot.

Claiborne was the first governor of Louisiana. He moved to New Orleans and oversaw the transfer of Louisiana to U.S. control after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. He then governed what would become the State of Louisiana, then termed the "Territory of Orleans," during its period as a United States territory from 1804 through 1812. He also has the distinction of perhaps being the youngest ever US congressman (the actual date of his birth, however, is unclear).

French born artist, Ambrose Duval, worked in New Orleans in the first three decades of the 19th century.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Florence MacKubin was born in Florence, Italy, though had Baltimore connections. She exhibited internationally after studying in Paris and Munich, and went on to paint many miniatures of society women in New York, Boston, St. Louis and Washington D.C..This portrait of the Baltimore bishop who was created cardinal by Pope Leo XIII was shown at the Royal Society of Miniature Painters in London in 1907, and at the Paris Salon of 1909. A numbers of works by the artist can be found in the Maryland State Art Collection.

    <PublicDescription>"This once powerful and ambitious tribe has dwindled away to a mere shadow of what it was at the time of the Revolution.  During the war between the French &amp; English for predominance in America, each of these parties made every effort to engage this tribe as an ally." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"The man who here deliberates is lost: i.e., loses his shot;- there is not much use in running the Elk without stratagem is used, either in heading them off, forcing them into the river, or waiting at some point hidden, and shooting them as they pass.  Their speed outstrips that of the horse.  When Buffalo are scarce, these are a desirable acquisition to the prairie larder, more from their weight than excellence of food.  The meat is inferior to either Buffalo, Bear, Mountain Sheep, or Deer.  The Indians manufacture a beautiful buckskin from their hides, very soft and strong, with which they make leggings, giving it a rich tint by a peculiar process of smoking;- they form it also sacks to carry their pemmican and jerked meat, and from the horns they make their most efficient bows.  The scene represented in the sketch is near a bluff in the vicinity of the upper waters of the Nebraska River.  The herds of Elk rarely number more than 4 or 500." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Jennie Walters was born in 1853, the daughter of William T. and Ellen Walters (née Harper), and the sister of Henry Walters. She was educated in Paris, and at St. Mary's Convent, Georgetown, and later at Harvard University. In Cambridge she met Warren Delano, a close friend of her brother. She became engaged, and they married in 1876. After her marriage she lived in Orange, New Jersey, and, from 1900, in New York City. She had seven children, five of whom lived into adulthood. She died in 1922.

Baker's contemporaries credited his success to his early work as a miniature painter, a craft he learned from his father. Such training helped the younger Baker hone his skills at modeling the human figure, creating delicate color effects, and fostering a sense of intimacy in full-scale oil portraits.

This is the second and later oil painting of Jennie by Baker owned by the Walters. The earlier shows her as a little girl (WAM 37.1207). This portrait probably shows her at about the time of her marriage, at the age of twenty-three.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Although this Sioux Indian has an immense range of his own to hunt over, he is not content with it, and we find him here on the grounds of the Blackfeet.  The retreating Indian is defending himself as he runs, as best he can; the shield which he uses is covered with bull-hide, and becomes so tough in time that no arrow can pepetrate its surface.  His great care is to protect the head and body, letting his extremities take their chance.  In case an arrow penetrates his leg or arm, he still continues his flight to a place of safety;- his capability to bear pain, and patience under its infliction, is wonderful.  When he is no longer pursued, if wounded, he sits down and cuts out the arrow;- compressing the wound with a bandage drawn tightly around it and inclosing medicinal plants very often, if they are to be found." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Jennie Walters was born in 1853, the daughter of William T. and Ellen Walters (née Harper), and the sister of Henry Walters. She was educated in Paris, and at St. Mary's Convent, Georgetown, and later at Harvard University. In Cambridge she met Warren Delano, a close friend of her brother. She became engaged, and they married in 1876. After her marriage she lived in Orange, New Jersey, and, from 1900, in New York City. She had seven children, five of whom lived into adulthood. She died in 1922.

Baker's contemporaries credited his success to his early work as a miniature painter, a craft he learned from his father. Such training helped the younger Baker hone his skills at modeling the human figure, creating delicate color effects, and fostering a sense of intimacy in full-scale oil portraits.

    <PublicDescription>Farnham served as the chief designer and director of the jewelry division of Tiffany &amp; Co. from 1893 until 1907 when he was replaced by Louis Comfort Tiffany. He frequently drew his designs from flowers and plants. This sketch is a working drawing for one of Tiffany's most famous creations, the Iris Corsage Ornament that won the firm a gold medal at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900 (WAM 57.939). Farnham collaborated with Tiffany's gemologist George Frederick Kunz (1856-1912) in using American stones, in this instance mostly Montana sapphires, for his exhibition pieces.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).</PublicDescription>

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"The avenger is behind and no house of refuge for the offender.  The disgrace to the poor devil in advance is not the act of stealing; his misfortune is in having been detected.  The Snakes and Crows being in close proximity, near the Rocky Mountains, are in frequent collision, and of course do each other as much harm as possible." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This drawing was specially commissioned from an as yet unidentified artist as the tailpiece to one of William T. Walters' albums of drawings. It shows a thistle growing up through the eye of a skull. The word "emigravit" appears below on a scroll. This is Latin for "departed," a word sometimes chosen for gravestone inscriptions. The thistle down blowing away in the wind is also a kind of momento mori.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>One of the social highlights of the rendezvous occured when this young woman ("quite a belle," Miller thought) ran off with a "stalwart Canadian trapper." Not knowing that the trapper had already begun paying court to the girl, one of Miller's friends, a young man from St. Louis named Phillipson, decided that she would be his. His presents and attentions were "kindly received," Miller noted, encouraging the young man. Phillipson felt embarrassed before the whole camp when the "simple Indian girl," realizing that her future was with the trapper, stole off quietly. Phillipson initially was "crest-fallen and melancholy," Miller recorded, but later regained his serenity.

    <PublicDescription>"The subject of the sketch is a defile in the mountains (called Black-Hills) through the bottom of which a brook takes its serpentine course;- at intervals may be seen a deserted Beaver-dam, the industrious architects having been either trapped, or driven off by the tide of emigration.  On the right a meadow covered with boulders runs down to the water, while opposite on the other side of the brook the mountain rises almost perpendicularly, faced with a reddish-grey granite, the tops and fissures clothed with stunted pines and firs.  In the distance higher peaks are seen overtopping these and closing the scene.  The plant called 'Artemesia' or wild sage abounds herabouts with its gnarled and twisted branches, the atmosphere being saturated with its overpowering odor of Camphor and turpentine,- these clumps are infested with rattle-snakes - who always give you fair warning to keep off." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>After George Washington's death in 1799 many Americans wished to own portraits of the first president and revolutionary hero. Miniatures were a popular format for these memorials. This image is after a portrait by Gilbert Stuart, today in the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown.

The miniature bares the initials "GS" for Gilbert Stuart and a date in a similar format to two miniatures after portraits by Stuart in the Metropolitan Museum (WAM 38.436 and 38.437, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Anthony). Stuart worked closely with the miniaturists Walter Robinson and Benjamin Trott, both of whom painted miniatures after Stuart's portraits in oils. It is possible that this miniature is by one of these men.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Gruppe was born in Canada. Primarily a landscape and marine painter, he was largely self-taught although he spent time studying in Holland. He won many honors including a gold medal at the American Art Association in 1902, and silver medals for oils and watercolors at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904. The Queen of Holland was one of his patrons. He was a member of the Pulchre Studio, The Hague; Arti, Amerdam; the New York Watercolor Club and the American Watercolor Society. This watercolor recalls the work of The Hague School which florished between 1860 and 1890 and included artists such as Jozef Israëls and Jacob Maris.

    <PublicDescription>"The Sioux from which this sketch was made held no rank either as chief or brave; - he was however a good specimen of the tribe, intelligent head, fine form, and was upwards of 6 feet high, of more than ordinary light colour for an Indian, and his whole bearing manly and dignified." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums.

    <PublicDescription>This painting was unknown until offered as a gift to the museum and did not appear in the Miller catalogue raisonné compiled by the Walters and the Amon Carter Museum in 1981. In the foreground, the woman is "cording a bale of dried meat," while in the background, Captain William Drummond Stewart, identified by his broad rimmed hat, addresses a male figure. It was Miller's practice to repeat his subjects for many clients. This work, however, is almost unique. There is a pen- and ink- sketch in a private collection that came assembled for Stewart. Otherwise, the only other variant is Walters 37.1940.153. What is atypical about this painting is that it is very thinly painted on artist's board rather than canvas. Pentimenti in the sky have become visible, allowing the viewer to determine how the artist developed the composition. Miller has apparently considered inserting a tree as he had in the other Walters watercolor, and then rejected the idea. Since this painting has not been identified with any listing in the artist's account book, it could be an early work dating from before 1842.

    <PublicDescription>Richards, a Philadelphia artist, first visited Tintagel on the Cornish coast in 1878. He recorded his impressions in a notebook which he subsequently drew upon in preparing a number of oil paintings and large gouaches.

Although the ruins visible on the cliffs date from the 13th century A.D., there is evidence of a sixth century substructure which lends credence to the legend that King Arthur was born on this site.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The son of a miniaturist, Baker spent almost his whole life in New York City, except for a trip to Italy in around 1846. He studied at the National Academy of Design. He was one of the most sought after portraitists of his time, but also painted ideal pieces, such as "Love at First Sight," and "The May Queen" (present location unknown). The Walters Art Museum owns 8 works by this artist; his works can also be found at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Tiffany was the foremost American exponent of the Art Nouveau movement, which rejected historical styles and called for a re-examination of vegetal and zoological motifs, particularly as seen in Japanese art. He developed it into a sensuous, organic style. The Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, founded in Corona, New York, in 1892, was particularly known for its "Favrile" glass, which imitated the iridescent sheen that ancient Roman glass acquired after being buried for centuries.

    <PublicDescription>The son of farmers who emigrated to New York in 1839, Boughton returned to settle permanently in England in 1861/2. Influenced by Frederick Walker, he also became a successful book illustrator. In this watercolor the artist adds a note of pathos to a scene of a rural interior in France; the crate which forms the baby's cradle is stamped with the word "FRAGILE." Together with what appears to be medicine bottles on the mantel and the woman's sad expression, we are led to conclude that the child's fate may be precarious. The religious print on the wall above the pair suggest that the family are part of the "deserving poor" who, in the 19th century, were seen as worthy of sympathy and help.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"This [Big Bowl] is a translation from the Indian name by the interpreter, who signified to him that we preferred his profile instead of front view of his face; - to this he objected, we wished to learn the reason, and after some delay, he said that if I had only one side of his face, in case he was in battle, I might have the power of making that side sick; - evidently looking on me as a species of magician. The reasoning was not very satisfactory, but he was determined to have his own way, a three-quarter view was the result." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"To have a good horse and full equipment is the realization of heaven on earth to an Indian girl, never having heard of the Poet's 'Beauty unadorned,' she goes to the other extreme, and piles it on as thick as possible, in the way of ornament; and what with hawk's bells innumerable, and tags of tin fastened to her fringes, the movements of her horse create abundance of noise as she gallops over the prairie.  The ornamented cloth attached to the crupper is made of the brightest colors, bordered with porcupine quills and beads, worked into geometric figures by her own hands;- streamers of the same material are pendant from the horse's ears, and 'possibly' sack depends from the saddle to which it is attached;- her feet rest on stirrups of a particulr form and make, well brought up.  The effect of the whole 'turn out' being extrememly picturesque to an artist's eye."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>In the 1840s Eastman Johnson studied in Düsseldorf, Germany, with Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze. Johnson also studied the work of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish masters in The Hague before ending his European travels in Paris, studying with the academic painter Thomas Couture in 1855. He spent the rest of his career in America. He is best known for his genre scenes and portraits. This charcoal study dates from the same year that he completed one of his best known paintings "A Ride for Liberty – The Fugitive Slaves," which depicts a slave family riding to freedom.

    <PublicDescription>Palmer, who was self-taught, was among the first American sculptors to break with the prevailing neoclassical style and adopt a more naturalistic approach. 

This plaster is of the left foot only of Palmer's sculpture "The White Captive." Palmer created a separate foot carved in marble in early 1860, carved by Charles Calverley, and that at least two plaster versions were also made. One is now at the Walters, and the other, which was formerly owned by Henry T. Tuckerman of New York, is now lost.

This plaster foot was found in the Walters' townhouse, at 5 West Mount Vernon Place, in the 1940s. Although no documentation relating to the foot has come to light, it is likely that it was acquired by, or given to William T. Walters around the time it was made. William purchased a bust of Flora from the artist and a full-length subject of a child, titled "First Grief." A daguerreotype of Palmer's "Sleeping Peri" is in the museum's archive, and was also found at 5 West Mount Vernon place.

    <PublicDescription>Rinehart probably modeled this bust of Jennie Walters (1853-1922) when she was traveling with her father in Europe in 1873. He had it carved into marble the following year, shortly before his death.

Upon her return to America, Jennie joined her brother Henry Walters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she met Warren Delano III, whom she married in 1876.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).  This sketch comes from a Vernon Miller Family Album.

    <PublicDescription>Mary Cassatt, the daughter of a wealthy Pennsylvania banker, traveled extensively through Italy, Belgium and Spain and trained in Paris with several notable teachers including Gérôme and Couture. She met Degas in 1877, and though their friendship would be fitful and end in total estrangement, the encounter proved meaningful for both artists. Under Degas' influence, Cassatt's early, earthy realist style gave way to a more impressionistic approach. He in turn, recruited a sympathetic artisan for his realist faction of Impressionism. Like Degas, Cassatt explored various techniques, including pastels and graphics. She also shared his abiding interest in Japanese art. Excluded from many of her male colleagues' haunts, Cassatt appropriated as her specialty images of upper-class women and children. Characteristic of her later work is this pastel, "Margot in Blue," showing a child wearing a floppy white bonnet and blue dress.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters.

    <PublicDescription>"Reclining against his Beaver and Buffalo packs the warrior is enjoying his dolce far niente while smoking his calumet.  If disposed to be ceremonious, he throws his first two whiffs upward, muttering some words between;- the next in a similar manner towards the ground.  Sometimes he varies the ceremony by merely throwing the stem upward, and then commencing to inhale (by way of variety), he exudes the smoke alternately - now through his nostrils, and again from his mouth, the fragrant fumes encircling above his head in a small cloud.  At a little distance (screened from the sun by a blanket) is seated his mild and patient help mate, ready to receive his imperial orders and execute them with cheerfulness, and on the broad prairie beyond, his vassals encircle the campfire, roasting their meat, and all agog for any foray their pugnacious leaders may hit upon,- never in any case, you may be sure, for the benefit of his neighbors." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In 1837, Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller journeyed to the frontier with the American Fur Company. Along the way, he made many sketches of Native Americans, concentrating particularly on their relationship with the fur trade. Miller commented on the conflict between the traders and the Shoshonee: "In passing down the Platte, the American Fur Comp[any]'s boats are constantly liable to attack from hostile Indians prowling on the banks . . . it is a dark day for the 'voyageurs' if the boat should run aground. . . ."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Oertel painted religious subjects as well as portraits. He was born in Bavaria and studied painting and engraving in Munich. He emigrated to American in 1848, settling in Newark, New Jersey. During the next two decades he earned his way by teaching art, painting portraits, engraving banknotes and designing ceiling decorations for the House of Representative in Washington D.C. In 1871 he became a priest of the Protestant Episcopal Church and for over twenty years he served parishes in North and South Carolina, District of Columbia, Tennessee, Missouri and Maryland.

    <PublicDescription>The principal lodge, says Miller, is sixty to seventy feet in diameter with a domelike roof perhaps forty feet high in the center.  The only light comes through a six-foot aperture at the top, which also permits the smoke to escape.  Miller compared the whole effect to the Pantheon at Rome.  Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Haseltine, a Philadelphian, trained in Europe between 1856 and 1858. He first visited the south of Italy in 1858, and returned to Europe in 1866, eventually settling in Rome.

The ancient city of Paestum, founded as Poseidonia or the city of Neptune by the Greeks, about 600 BC, was laid waste in the 11th century. During the 19th century, it began to attract tourists who came to marvel at its three, remarkably extant temples.

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length, full face portrait of Mr. John T.(? or W.?) Pilling, with dark curly hair and moustache, wearing a dark blue coat with black velvet collar, gold buttons on coat, white shirt and high white collar and white stock tied in a bow. The frame claims that the portrait is of Edgar Allan Poe, but this was proved to be spurious when an inscription was found on the back of the portrait reading "Mr. John T. [or perhaps W.?] Pilling, Frankford, May 24th 1834." The attribution to Anna Claypoole Peale is also questionable.

It is likely that the sitter is related to the factory owner Samuel Pilling who in about 1820 built one of the first mills for the block printing of calico in Frankford, a mill-town near Philadelphia. There are a number of references to John Pilling in 19th-century publications suggesting that he was a wealthy textile manufacturer in Newark, Delaware. This John Pilling seems to have married for the first time in 1851, at around the age of twenty-one, but this would not match with the date written on the back of the miniature, unless perhaps this indicates a date of birth, rather than the date at which the portrait was completed.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Thomas Charles Farrer was born in London and trained at the Working Men's College, where from 1854 to 1858 John Ruskin taught elementary classes. Farrer embraced Ruskin's teaching and on his arrival in New York, in ca. 1857, championed his former teacher's ideas. This drawing shows Ruskin's influence in the close observation of nature and meticulous detailing.

This drawing is mounted on separate sheet of paper. Around the drawing is a border, and beneath it an inscription in red ink. On the verso is an impression of the frontispiece from one of William T. Walters' two albums of American drawings. Given that this album was put together in 1859 we can assume that Walters acquired it at this time.

    <PublicDescription>"We found among the North-Western Indians a belief in a great overruling power,- they believed also in an evil one, and while they regard suspiciously the former, take precious good care, also, to conciliate the favor of the latter... When a storm prevails, and thunder is crashing over their heads, they know nothing of positive or negative clouds approaching each other and discharging a surplus of electricity.  With them it is the 'Anger of a Great Spirit,' who is displeased with his children.  They become fightened, hang their heads, and deprecate his wrath;- their resolution for the moment is to do better.  These resoves pass off however as soon as the cause is removed;- their consciences beign quieted and reconciled by the appearance of clear weather."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

Ellen Wallace Sharples (1769-1849) met artist and portraitist James Sharples (1751-1811) in Bath when she became his student.  She would become his third wife in 1787. In 1794 they left England for the United States. The couple travelled widely, making portraits of many of the prominent personalities of the day. After her husband died in 1811, Ellen returned to the United Kingdom, settling in Bristol where she founded the Bristol Academy with a gift of £2000.

    <PublicDescription>"The saddle of the females is of singular form, the pummel extending upwards about 2 feet; - the cantle about 14 inches, the top of each turning outward, scroll fashion, the body of the saddle carved out of strong wood, is covered with tanned Bull-hide, places on when moist, it bleaches in drying, conforming precisely to the shape underneath, giving great strength and beauty of form.  From the end of each scroll hang pendants made of brilliant colors, worked tastily with beads and fringes, and over the body of the saddle is a mass of scarlet cloth, or a 'mackinaw,' on which the rider is seated; - on one side hangs her sack of 'possibles' worked most elaborately in porcupine quills; - her dress also is ornamented with the same material; - attached to the fringes are generally a number of hawks bells, - a present from some trapper likely.  Having a great penchant for the 'free trappers' (who are regarded as the highest ton) all their aspirations are in that direction.  The mode of riding on horseback by the female is à la Turque."   A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The scene in the sketch presents something of a bird's eye view of the great chain of Wind River Mountains, throwing up their huge heads against a warm evening sky, their lofty pinnacles crested with snow and reflecting light with the brilliancy of burnished silver;- Across the green plateau to the right, the Caravan is seen winding its slow length along.  In front of this, wild and rough rocks covered with a primeval growth of hemlocks, firs, and pines jut out into the river that is sweeping by, fed by the melting snows of the mountians.  In the immediate foreground some Trappers are galloping to join a party who are on the extreme end of the bluff, looking at the 'promised land' which forms their mountian home; for at the base of these, they expect to meet large bands of their brother Trappers with whom they promise themselves a grand arouse and drinking bout;- in order to repay themselves for the abstinence they are compelled to observe in a military and well-governed camp." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

Ann Brunton (1769-1808) was the first actress of eminence that crossed the Atlantic. She acted first in Bath and London where she attained great distinction, and was rated by many as second only to Mrs. Siddons. In 1792 she married Robert Merry, a socially advantageous match, although her husband, who was an ameteur playright, had soon spent all of his inhertitance. She retired from the theatre after her marriage, and the couple lived in Paris, but financial constraints meant that she had to return to the stage. The couple for the United States, arriving in New York City in 1796. Ann found great success in her new home, and after Robert Merry's death, she married twice more, to Thomas Wignell, who had first offered her a role in American, and finally to William Warren, a fellow actor.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In this wooded landscape, a young nymph is bathing. Baer was admired for his "ideal" subjects as well as for his portraits. This miniature and "Aurora" (Walters 38.169) are among his most famous works.

William Jacob Baer was born in Cincinnati in 1860, where he was trained in lithography. In 1880 he traveled to Munich to study drawing and painting at the Royal Academy. When he returned to the United States, he lived in New Jersey where he taught drawing and painting at Princeton University. In 1893 he moved to New York and where he first painted portrait miniatures; by 1894 he had given up easel painting all together to focus exclusively on this genre. He helped found the American Society of Miniature Painters, and is considered instrumental in the revival of miniature at the end of the 19th century. Baer exhibited both nationally and internationally, at the Exposition Universelle (1900), Pan-American Exposition (1901), Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904), and the Panama-Pacific Exposition (1915), where he work was well received. He seems to have found particular success with Henry Walters and his relatives. The Walters Art Museum holds six works on ivory by the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>While at the rendezvous of trappers, Miller had frequent opportunities to observe "trials of skill," one of the Indians' chief amusements. Of course, they bet on the results - beaver pelts against blankets, beads against wampum, pipes against tobacco. "This proceeds," Miller wrote, "until at last the very dresses they have on are placed in the scale of chances, sometimes reducing the poor devils almost to the condition of Adam, gambling being one of their strong passions."

The contests themselves - marksmanship with the elk-horn bow - were usually conducted on a calm day over a distance of thirty to forty yards. The arrows, shown being made by the figure at the left, were tipped with flint or iron, with a neat and balanced feather on the end. With the elk-horn bow they could "drive an arrow completely through a buffalo," Miller claimed. The targets shown in this sketch were circles two or three inches in circumference.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The Lariat used for this purpose is composed of plaited Bull-hide, is remarkably strong, pliable, and of sufficient weight for throwing well, about 25 feet ong, one end generally secured to the rider's horse, the other having a running noose, held by the right hand, the coil being so arranged as not to tangle when the rope is thrown.  On approaching the band, his body swaying to and fro, the noose part is flourished above the head, and as opportunity offers, is flung with great precision and dexterity, around the neck or leg, whichever appears most feasible to the Indian; and the tame horse is so trained that he immediately resists the strain by bracing himself back, against the suddenness of the jerk.  Another mode of capturing is called by the trapper 'creasing' with the rifle, the object is to lodge the ball at the junction of the mane with the neck; if this is attained. the horse is knocked down, and only stunned, is secured and broken.  This requires of course, a good marksman, or in the Vernacular, one who shoots 'Center.'"  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Natives from Savoy emigrated to Paris, where they frequently eked out a living as chimney sweeps or as itinerant musicians. Miller executed a preliminary drawing of this subject in Paris in 1834, which he preserved in a scrapbook. He presented this oil sketch to Jennie Walters (1853-1922), the daughter of his patron, William T. Walters. The syntax in Jennie's letter of acknowledgment suggests that the gift was made after the Walters' return from Europe following the Civil War. Miller repeated this theme in another sketch, also in a family scrapbook, showing Jean Valjean and a young Savoyard with a hurdy-gurdy, characters taken from Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" of 1862.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Heald, as a young man, was a member of the firm of John H. Heald and Co., tanners, at North and Madison streets, Baltimore.  He married Sarah Malvina Allen (September 15, 1824-December 16, 1854) in 1844, by whom he had three children, Mary Elizabeth (1851-1935), Emma Eliza (145-1920), and James Allen (1849-1889).  As a companion piece, Miller painted a portrait of Mrs. Heald (WAM 37.2511).  The children were subsequently portrayed by another local artist, Henry Bebie.  Following the death of Sarah Malvina, Heald remarried.  Though he retired from the business at an early age, he took an active interest in a number of ventures, including the construction of the Mount Vernon Methodist Church.  Probably as a result of the business ties between his brothers Decatur and Columbus and the Healds, Miller executed a number of portraits of members of the Heald family.</PublicDescription>

The sitter is probably David Paul Brown (1795-1872), a Philadelphia lawyer, poet, orator and playwright of both tragedies and farce. An obituary recorded that "From the early times of 'anti-slavery' and 'abolition' in Philadelphia, Mr. Brown was the steadfast friend, counselor, spokesman and orator for the anti-slavery party. He was their chivalrous champion upon nearly all occasions, important and unimportant, in court, on the rostrum and in the newspapers. It may be said with safety that he never failed to answer their call." (See "The Albany Law Journal," vol. 6, 1872, pp. 49-50).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Hart was a Scottish-born American landscape and cattle painter, and Hudson River School artist. This drawing shows two figures on the river bank. The female figure seems to look down at a seated male figure who appears to be sketching. His younger brother was also an artist and they worked in similar styles (see WAM 37.1566).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"Although an Indian's life is tolerably worthless to any but himself, yet he uses every stratagem, fair and foul, to preserve it, and  is often indebted to his litheness and activity for this result.  The duello would by no means suit him.  In battle (if on foot) he chooses his ground, so that he may retreat behind trees, rocks &amp;c. in case of emergency.  In skirmishing on horseback, he makes a target of his horse, watching the deadly arrow of his adversary;- he quick as lightning clings to his horse's neck;- dropping his body to the opposite side, exposing but a part of his arm and leg to his enemy,- sometimes he holds on simply by the heel, while the horse is in full motion.  In such an attitude he will discharge his arrows under the horse's neck, recovering his seat in a moment;- this is only attained by long practice,- a broken neck certanly awaits any one who tries to accomplish the feat for the first time."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"As hunter, keen and active in pursuit of game, the Pawnees were well enough,- in other respects we could not say much for them, a band of about 20 came down on us one day as we were encamped, and although in their war paint, and looking ripe for mischief, made signs of friendship and good will;- our interpreter was put into communication, and among other questions, he was directed to as, 'where they were going?'  Our gravity was sorely tried by the answer they made us and the perfectly innocent look that accompanied it.  'Oh,' said they, 'we are only going over here to the Mandans to try and steal a few horses.'  Well - well.  By dint of presence &amp;c., we rid ourselves of them as quick as possible, a double guard was ordered out at night, and a general over-hauling of all the rifles in camp, amid the curses loud and deep of the bellicose trappers.A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length portrait said to be of Sarah Goodridge (also spelt Goodrich, 1788-1853) looking slightly to the left, with dark brown straigh hair parted in the center, wearing a red velvet dress with narrow white lace collar on a mauve background. 

Goodridge was born on a farm in Templeton, Massachusetts, the sixth of nine children. In Boston she took drawing lessons. Subsequently she was taught the technique of miniature painting on ivory and by 1818 was listed in the Boston directory as a miniature painter. In 1820 she opened her own studio and made a successful career as an artist. Among Goodridge's most interesting and personal work is a miniature portrait of her own bared breasts, entitled "Beauty Revealed," now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Although the sitter resembles a self-portrait of Goodridge dated to 1830, she also appears somewhat younger in this work dated to ca. 1835.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Jean Henri Latude sought to gain the attentions of Mme de Pompadour, Louis XV's companion, by sending her a poisoned box and then revealing an alleged plot against her. His prank failed and he was imprisoned for many years in the Bastille and Vincennes. While incarcerated, he wrote his memoirs.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The artist who completed this portrait was probably James L. Wattles, a portrait painter active in Baltimore from ca. 1829 to 1854. He is said to have been a rival of Alfred Jacob Miller in portraying Native Americans. Wattles seems to have had a son who painted portraits, J. Henry Wattles. He is known to have been living in Baltimore in 1842.

The Marquis de Lafayette was a French aristocrat and military officer who served with distinction under George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. This is a copy of a portrait of the Marquis by the French artist of Dutch-German ancestry, Ary Scheffer. The portrait was brought to the United States during Lafayette's return trip, taken on the invitation of President James Munroe from 1824 to 1825, during which he toured widely. The Schaffer portrait can now be found in the House of Representatives in Washington DC. Other copies of the work exist, suggesting Lafayette's popular heroic status at this time.

    <PublicDescription>The son of a miniaturist, Baker spent almost his whole life in New York City, except for a trip to Italy in around 1846. He studied at the National Academy of Design. He was one of the most sought after portraitists of his time, but also painted ideal pieces, such as "Love at First Sight," and "The May Queen" (present location unknown). This is a rare example of his work as a genre painter. Baker seems to have found particular favor with William T. Walters. The artist was also commissioned to portrayed Ellen Harper Walters, William's wife, and their daughter, Jennie (see WAM 37.2637 and WAM 37.1207).The Walters Art Museum owns 8 works by this artist; his works can also be found at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Once the meat is in camp, it is turned over to John, the cook, and his preparation, wrote Miller, "although simple, in the extreme, is perfection in itself.  With a stick sharpened at one end he skewers it lengthwise leaving about sixteen inches of the stick bare.  This part he plants in the ground near the fire, inclining the meat inwardly at the top.  Gradually a crisp surface forms over the fat and as the roasting process goes on it is thus driven back into the meat without need of any basting.  When done it is a dish for an Emperor, exceeding the flavor, richness and juiciness [of] all other beef preparations."

But John was not the only one who knew how to prepare the hump rib, as Miller shows here.  The hunters LaJeunesse, Burrows, and François have prepared that most delicate of treats and are roasting it around a smoldering fire.  After the meal, the trappers would settle down for an evening of exchanging accounts of impossible deeds, and Sir William Drummond Stewart would entrance them all with stories of his Napoleonic battles or of exotic and undreamed-of places.

This small watercolor, prepared for William T. Walters, is similar in composition to the large oil painting that Miller made for Stewart, although some of the individuals pictured are different.  In the large oil, Antoine Clement is shown instead of LaJeunesse, Pierre instead of François, and Stewart is shown in the distance.</PublicDescription>

He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.

    <PublicDescription>According to Greek myth, the women of Thrace tore Orpheus, a mythical poet, to pieces after he rejected their advances. His head floated across the Mediterranean Sea to the island of Lesbos, which then became the foremost center for lyre music in antiquity. Berge, a native of Baltimore, attended the Rinehart School of Sculpture at the Maryland Institute. He later studied in Paris under Raoul Verlet and Auguste Rodin. After his return to Baltimore, he became one of the city's foremost sculptors. The model for this sculpture was dated 1899. It was exhibited at the Salon d'automne in Paris in 1900 where it received the Clark prize, and was shown again at the Panama Pacific Exposition of 1915. The sculptor, who regarded this piece as one of his most important works, had intended to remove the marble struts supporting the figure's arms after the piece had been purchased.

    <CreditLine>Commissioned by William T. Walters, 1858-1860</CreditLine>
    <PublicDescription>"August has ready the Captain's horse, who is giving some directions to Antoine (a Canadian half-bred), his prime hunter to the camp: While in London, the Captain had purchased 3 'Joe Mantons' at about 40 guineas each; these guns were famous in their day for shooting point blank, or as the Trappers style it, 'plum centre,' and in the hands of a true marksman like Antoine, the Buffaloes had to 'go under.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837). The Captain referred to here is the Scottish nobleman, William Drummond Stewart. Antoine is Antoine Clement, his companion and, later, butler.

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>The sitter's identity has not been determined, but it is possible that rather than being a portrait this is an allegorical subject similar to "Aurora" (WAM 38.169). 

William Jacob Baer was born in Cincinnati in 1860, where he was trained in lithography. In 1880 he traveled to Munich to study drawing and painting at the Royal Academy. When he returned to the United States, he lived in New Jersey where he taught drawing and painting at Princeton University. In 1893 he moved to New York and where he first painted portrait miniatures; by 1894 he had given up easel painting all together to focus exclusively on this genre. He helped found the American Society of Miniature Painters, and is considered instrumental in the revival of miniature at the end of the 19th century. Baer exhibited both nationally and internationally, at the Exposition Universelle (1900), Pan-American Exposition (1901), Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904), and the Panama-Pacific Exposition (1915), where he work was well received. He seems to have found particular success with Henry Walters and his relatives. The Walters Art Museum holds six works on ivory by the artist.

    <PublicDescription>When the caravan approached a river, "a trusty and experienced man is... selected whose business it is to cross the river and try its depths, and then return by a different route, looking out [for] the shallowest parts and marking them in his mind's eyes as a trail for the company." If the river was not shallow enough for the wagons to cross, everything had to be unloaded and bull boats- the wagon beds covered with buffalo hides- had to be constructed and all the caravan's goods floated across.  Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Every day at 12 o'clock the caravan halts, the horses are permitted to rest and feed, men receive their dinner, and then take a Siesta... The time however to me was too valuable to indulge in the luxury,- so immediatly after the halt, I would mount the wagon, get out my port-folio, and go to work.  Our Captain, who took great interest in this matter, came up to me one day while so engaged, &amp; said 'you should sketch this and that thing' and so on. 'Well!' I answered (possibly with a slight asperity). 'if I had half a dozen pair of hands, it should ahve been done!'"  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"Before they are 16 years of age, these girls may be siad to have thier hey-day, and even if they become the wives or mates of Trappers, are comparatively happy, for they generally indulge them to their hearts' content; should they become however the squaws of Indians, their lives are subjected to the caprices of a tyrant too often, whose ill treatment is the rule and kindness their exception.  Nothing so strikingly distinguishes civilized from savage life as the treatment of women.  It is in every particular in favor of the former.  The scene in the sketch is a sunset view on the prairie,- a Shoshonee girl reclined on a Buffalo robe near a stream, and some lodges and Indians in the distance." A.J.

    <PublicDescription>"This building, situated at the time on the Western frontier of the United States, was the last house we encountered previous to entering the wilderness.  It was inhabited by a Shawnee Indian, who for a wonder had been benefited by civilization, for he here cultivated successfully about 100 acres of arable land, and had everything in plenty around him.  The building was 50 feet in length, flanked by kitchen and offices, built of logs dovetailed at the corners, with a Hall through the centre about 15 feet wide, and was altogether a most comfortable country residence.  Here we witnessed an Indian marriage, and after it came a feast, - the tables spread with a profusion of substantials, music and dancing closing the ceremonies.  We encamped here for about a week, purchasing mules and making our final preparation for a savage life." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>James G. Harwood was regarded as a promising young Baltimore artist when he died mysteriously of gun-shot wounds at the age of 28. Little is known of his career other than that he had studied for a year in New York with William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) and had also enrolled for two years at the Académie Julian in Paris, a popular destination for Americans training in Paris.

In this scene, Harwood has portrayed the Maryland Fifth Regiment marching up Charles Street in Baltimore on a rainy day. Two dates have been suggested for this work, the Defenders' Day celebration in September 1889 or the celebration of the ending of the Spanish-American War on September 7, 1898. On both occasions, it rained.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In the spring of 1837, Captain William Drummond Stewart hired the Baltimorean Alfred Jacob Miller to accompany and record an expedition to the annual fur traders' rendezvous held in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in what is now Wyoming. That autumn, the artist returned east with sketches and watercolors, which served as the basis for later paintings. Miller observed that Americans could find in their own country "a race of men equal in form and grace (if not superior) to the finest ideal ever dreamed of by the Greeks."  
          
With the financial assistance of Baltimore collector Robert Gilmor, Jr., Miller studied in Europe in 1832-33, where he was attracted to the works of the Romantic artists, particularly Decamps and Delacroix, as well as to paintings he saw in the Louvre Museum by Dutch 17th-century masters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>Mayer, a Baltimore painter, trained with the local artists Ernst Fischer and Alfred Jacob Miller before moving to Paris in 1864-69 to enroll in the studio of Charles Gleyre, the academic master who included among his pupils the impressionists Monet, Sisley, Bazille, and Renoir. Mayer seems to have been close to William T. Walters as a fellow member of the Allston Association, and as the Maryland Historical Societies assistant librarian for the Gallery of Fine Arts. Beginning in 1848 the Historical Society presented annual exhibitions of Old Master paintings and contemporary works drawn from local collections. Rhinehart was another artist who was on personal terms with William T. Walters and was also from Maryland. He executed portraits of William, his wife, Ellen, and his daughter, Jennie. This portrait therefore brought together two men from William's close circle of artistic friends.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>The Fink miniature catalog describes this as a bust-length, three-quarter right self-portrait of William Russell Birch. However, a note in the file of a now lost inscription on the back of the frame gives the date of the portrait as 1835, the year after Birch died. In addition the inscription is ambigious. It could be read as suggesting that the portrait was a gift from the artist to his daughter, or that the portrait was painted by Louisa Birch "from her father."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Miller frequently made drawings of subjects from popular literature, particularly the works of Charles Dickens. The subject of this unusual painted character study is a humorous incident from Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" (1841), which turns out to have far-reaching consequences for the larger plot of the novel. The clerk, Dick Swiveller, plays cribbage while his masters are away:

"As these games were very silently conducted . . . Mr. Swiveller began to think that . . . he heard a kind of snorting or hard-breathing sound in the direction of the door, which it occurred to him, after some reflection, must proceed from the small servant, who always had a cold from damp living. Looking intently that way one night, he plainly distinguished an eye gleaming and glistening at the keyhole; and having now no doubt that his suspicions were correct, he stole softly to the door, and pounced upon her before she was aware of his approach."

Swiveller nicknames this small servant "the Marchioness" and teaches her to play cribbage.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Cape May, New Jersey, is among the oldest American seaside resorts, hosting vacationers from the mid-Atlantic region from the 18th century forward. In this drawing, Miller pokes gentle fun at leisure travelers. Two men seated on folding stools sit on the sand despite clouds of annoying insects. The caption reads:

Consolation for the afflicted!-who cannot go to Cape May,-viz-
"Can't get away Club", -"when there is a land breeze,-two gangs of 
mosquitoes are laid on!!-the wide-awake squad, reserved for the night!!!"

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>At the close of the fur-traders' rendezvous, Miller's patron, the Scottish Sir William Drummond Stewart, took a small group of friends fishing and hunting in the Wind River Mountains. Miller recalled the region as a sportsman's paradise, with crystal clear lakes in which trout were so plentiful that they could be caught with pins rather than with fishhooks.
	
This painting was commissioned by William C. Wilson in 1853.

    <PublicDescription>"After a chase the Buffalo has fallen on his knees from exhaustion and loss of blood.  The Indian's horse to the right has become restive &amp; refuses to approach, while the horseman to the left, with a javelin or lance is about to give the coup de grace.  The lance is from 7 to 10 feet long, neatly pointed with iron, secured by sinew tightly gound to the rod, and is a most effectual weapon in the practiced hands of the Indians;- they carry also their quivers slung from the shoulders in case of breakage of the former, or to be used in an emergancy where the bow and arrow would better answer their purposes.  The chase of the Bison is attended with daner, for although in general shy, and flying from the face of man, yet when wounded they become furious, and make fight to the last; They use their hoofs with as much facility as their horns, and whatever opposes them runs no small risk of being trampled to death." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>John La Farge traveled to Japan and the South Seas with the historian Henry Adams in the 1880s. During a six-week stay in Japan, La Farge stayed in Nikko, a Tokugwana mortunary temple town 145 kilometers nothwest of Tokyo, at the homes of Boston "japanophiles" and recent converts to Buddhism, William Sturgis Bigelow and Ernest Francisco Fenollosa. On this trip, La Farge painted this watercolor, showing the mortuary gateway, leading into the temple complex of Emperor Iyeyasu (1543-1616). This is one of the few works La Farge brought to completion on the trip; the majority of works with Nikko subject matter were completed between 1887 and 1889 when he was reworking his journals and preparing illustrations for travel articles published in "Century Magazine" between 1890 and 1893. However, he may have used a photograph purchased by Adams as a memory-aid in completing this work (see James L. Yarnall, "Recreation and Idleness: The Pacific Travels of John La Farge," 1998, p. 25, fig. 34).

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length, three quarter profile portrait of a young lady with dark brown hair, wearing a blue dress with white lace collar and gold necklace.

This is signed J. H. Brown. It must be a late work if by this artist, as the fashion and hair style date from around 1890 and Brown died in 1891. Brown was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and studied painting with Arthur Armstrong, a fine-art, sign, and "fancy" painter. At the age of 21, Brown set up his own business in Lancaster and also taught himself miniature painting. He combined the look of new photographic processes with the colors and composition of oil painting, often basing his portraits on daguerreotypes and later ambrotypes. This miniature has the appearance of being after a photograph. Brown exhibited frequently at the Pennsylvania Academy until 1864 when he joined the photography practice of Frederick Augustus Wenderoth and W. Curtis Taylor, which became the firm of Wenderoth, Taylor, Brown. Brown tinted photographs in the era before color photography, a skill that was in demand in order to create accurate colored likenesses. However, Brown did not completely abandon miniature painting, as this was a practice still in demand among elite clients. In 1876 Brown received a medal for his miniatures at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In crossing some of these rivers we encountered banks 40 or 50 feet high, with a rough road so steep that it was essential to unharness the mules &amp; horses;- attach ropes to the wagons, man them and pull until they reached the table land,- while this heavy and overpowering work was bing done by the Trappers, the Indians would be sitting or standing near us, and looking at us with quiet complacency - presents and all reasonable inducements were offered them to lend a hand.  Not a man would stir.  At last the Trapers, losing all patience, change their tactics and give them a round of peculiar French expletives,- thus throwing away their religion and good temper at the same moment.  Luckily for the poor Indians, they were innocuous, as most likely they understood not a single word.  The inquiry did not occur,- by what right we require them to help us? The scene fo the sketch is where horses are available.  Some attached to the vehicles are essaying the hill while others are in the river below, awaitign thier turns." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>It was probably the "Asiatic type, the eyes being almond shaped and slightly turned up at the corners," that attracted Miller to paint this Chinook Indian portrait. He was a "favorable specimen, about 22 years of age," and holding a remarkable bow made of elk-horn with a sinew string, which Miller also drew.

    <PublicDescription>The men were tormented by thirst several times while crossing the prairie.  It was not unusual in such a situation to see a delightful lake looming on the horizon.  When the horses did not "quicken their motion, or snort," Miller knew that he was seeing a mirage.  Although Miller is noted for the first pictures of the Rocky Mountain fur trade, he also painted some of the freshest and most candid prairie scenes to come out of the overland trail.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Weeks was the most avid traveler among the American orientalists. He did not limit his journeys to the Near East, but also visited India in 1882 and again from 1892 through 1894. After returning to his studio in France, he specialized in Indian subjects, which were based on photographs and drawings made during his travels. In this painting, he depicts the famous tomb erected in 1630 by Shah Jahan for his wife.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Ma-wo-ma, whose name was somewhat misleading because it translates "Little Chief," was leader of the approximately three thousand Snake Indians, many of whom came to the rendezvous.  He was "decidedly in every sense superior to any Indian that we had met," Miller declared.  "He was a man of high principle, in whom you could place confidence."

Miller and Ma-wo-ma were both artists, neither terribly appreciative of the other's work: "I noticed that all four of the legs of the horses were on one side," Miller observed of one of Ma-wo-ma's paintings.  "This arose from a want of knowledge of perspective.  He also colored them with the stick end of a brush instead of the hair end,- not probably having seen before an article of this kind... A running commentaary was kept up while he proceeded with the drawing.  There was a little more of the 'ego' than good taste might have dictated but it sat with exceeding grace on our excellent friend Ma-Wo-Ma.  And the interpreter so far from softening no doubt exaggerated- as such gentry are wont to do."  Ma-wo-ma criticized Miller's work for being too much like the "vulgar and familiar species of art" that he could see in his "looking glass."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Miller was the only painter to portray during their heyday the men who "may be said to lead the van in the march of civilization,- from the Canadas in the North to California in the South;- from the Mississippi East to the Pacific West; every river and mountain stream, in all probability, have [sic] been at one time or another visited and inspected by them."  Perhaps they numbered no more than a thousand, but their impact was incalculable.

Here Miller has pictured two of that company, one of them probably Black Harris.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Although he was an accomplished portraitist, Elliott had received little formal training apart from six months in 1829 spent in the studio of John Quidor (1801-81), who had broken with the traditional realism prevailing in the first half of the 19th century to produce highly fanciful scenes taken from the literature of Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper. In this scene, Elliott appears to acknowledge his indebtedness to Quidor who, by then, had been almost completely forgotten by the public.

In this work, Elliott had depicted the rotund Anthony Van Corlear, who won "prodigious favor in the eyes of the women by means of his whiskers and his trumpet." This scene is taken from Washington Irving's "Diederich Knickerboker's, A History of New York," (1809).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Gruelle was born in Cynthiana, Kentucky in 1851. He was both an artist and a writer. He got his start painting signs for commercial businesses before moving to Indianapolis. During the administration of President Benjamin Harrison, Gruelle was invited to paint in the nation's capital by the art connoisseur Herbert Hess who also came from Indianapolis. At the urging of his friend the artist spent several seasons in the early 1890s exploring the East Coast (WAM 37.306 may well be a product of this period). In the spring of 1892 during a painting trip to Washington Gruelle was invited to Baltimore to examine the collections of William T. Walters. Although not experienced in literature he was invited to write entries on the highlights of the collection for the new magazine "Modern Art." A copy was sent to Walters who asked him to write an account of his collection. Gruelle later warmly remembered Walters' hospitality. Stating that Walters told him "You must feel, while in my house, that it is yours. I have given strict orders that while you are here taking notes of my pictures, no one shall be admitted. I want you to be alone with the pictures." Guelle's "Notes: Critical and Biographical" was published in April 1895.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length, almost full view portrait of George Washington wearing a powdered wig, black coat with upright collar, white stock and lace jabot. The miniature was painted for Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, née Nellie Custis on order from Thomas H. Perkins (1764-1854). The inscription on the back reads, "Presented to Mrs. Lewis by her respectful servant, J.H. Perkins."

After George Washington's death in 1799 many Americans wished to own portrait of the first president and revolutionary hero. Miniatures were a popular format for these memorials. This image is after a portrait by Gilbert Stuart, today in the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In the wildest and most secluded haunts of the mountains, on high rocky peaks, these animlas [mountain sheep] are mostly found. They remain on the peaks all day long, and in the evening and early morning come down seeking water and grass. The meat in season is excellent, having a trifle more of the wild flavor than ours." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Asher Durand spent the first two decades of his working life as an engraver. During the 1830s he turned to painting portraits, and then, encouraged by Thomas Cole, to landscapes. By the 1840s Durand was concentrating on landscapes exclusively. Working in New York City, he became a close colleague of Cole, and served as president of the National Academy of Design. He regularly ventured into remote areas of the Catskill, Adirondack, and White Mountains to make sketches, which he used in the landscapes composed in his studio during the winter.

This work was formerly housed in one of William T. Walters' many drawings albums.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>The Green River of Wyoming (Oregon Territory to Miller) winds through spectacular mountains to join the Colorado River. Miller trekked through the Rockies for one season and noted many difficulties, especially for those who tried to climb the highest peaks, only to experience "giddiness and headache, attended with vomiting," and turn back.

He has included a camp of Indians en route to the rendezvous near the shore of what might well be Frémont Lake, a romantic touch emphasizing the harmony between unspoiled nature and natural man.

"The sun did not appear to shine so brightly to us the balance of the day," Miller recalls, lamenting the loss of one of his friends.  Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This portrait shows Ellen Harper Walters, the wife of William T. Walters and mother of Henry Walters (founder of the Walters Art Museum). She married William in 1846.

The son of a miniaturist, Baker spent almost his whole life in New York City, except for a trip to Italy in around 1846. He studied at the National Academy of Design. He was one of the most sought after portraitists of his time, but also painted ideal pieces, such as "Love at First Sight," and "The May Queen" (present location unknown). 
Baker seems to have found particular favor with William T. Walters. As well as portraying William's wife, he also painted their daughter, Jennie (WAM 37.1207). The Walters Art Museum owns 8 works by this artist; his works can also be found at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</PublicDescription>

The Squaw's station in travelling is at a considerable distance in the rear of her liege lord, and never at the side of him.  W----r had the kindness to present the writer a dozen pair of moccasins worked by this squaw - richly embroidered on the instep with colored porcupine quills."   A.J.

    <PublicDescription>"This mode of killing Buffalo is often resorted to, and with attention to certain rules very successfully.  The hunters having descried the animals at a distance decided whether it is most prudent to run or approach them.  If the latter, as in teh present case, they ascertain how the wind is.  If from the buffalo, they immediately commence their approach.  If from themselves, they immediately start off making a wide circuit to the other side of the herd.  The reason of this is that the animal's keenness of scent is most acute, and will take the alarm at the distance of a mile or more; while his eyesight is obstruced with the great mass of hair covering his head."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Toward the end of the trappers' rendezvous, Captain Stewart (the Scottish nobleman), amid great ceremony, presented gifts to various chiefs, braves, and warriors who had performed some meritorious action or who had rendered personal services to Stewart or his group.  These were "the 'elite,' the 'creme de la creme,'" said Miller.  "They attached great importance to the matter, as it gives them a certain status with their people." Antoine, behind Stewart, is selecting Bowie knives and other gifts, which were also intended to ensure the friendship of a large group of Indians, because a hostile group of Blackfeet was rumored to be nearby.

    <PublicDescription>" Of all the Indian tribes I think the Pawnee gave us the most trouble, and were (of all) to be most zealously guarded against.  We knew that the Blackfeet were our deadly enemies, forwarned here was to be forearmed.  Now the Pawnees pretended amity, and were a species of 'confidence Men.'  They reminded us of two German students meeting for the first time, and one saying to the other, 'Let's you and I swear eternal friendship.'  In passing through their country, it was most desirable and indeed essential to cultivate their good will, but these fellow had le main croche.  They could not, or would not, distinguish meum &amp; teum.  Whether they were within the Camp or in our vicinity it was requisite to put a ddoulbe guard over the horses.  Then when we were en route we were continually under their surveillance, and we knew it.  From the tops of bluffs, behind rocks, and out of the long grass of the prairie, they watche us and kept themselves posted; transmitting no doubt intelligence to 'headquarters.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length portrait of Mrs. William Wallace Taylor, Jr. (Catharine Augusta Birckhead) with brown hair parted in the center, small lace cap draped over each ear with pink rose at each side, wearing a dark green, low-cut dress with white lace collar. Her grandfather, Solomon, was one of its incorporators of the Union Bank of Maryland, of which her husband (see companion piece WAM 38.480) became Director in 1861. She married in 1847 and died in 1881. The family lived in 7 West Mount Vernon Place, making them the neighbours of the Walters family who lived at 5 West. (For more information see "History of Baltimore Maryland, from its founding as a town to the current year, 1792-1898").

Born in Leeds, England, and trained in an architect's office, Richard Morrell Staigg came to the United States in 1831. Washington Allston encouraged him and he soon devoted himself to miniature painting. He was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy of Design, New York City, of which he was elected an associate in 1856, and an academician in 1861. In the last two decades of his life he devoted himself to portraits, landscapes and genre scenes in oil.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>While recovering from a leg wound received during his apprenticeship with a ship builder, Rogers, a Long Islander, took up miniature painting and became one of the most successful artists in that field in New York through the 1830s. The identity of the subject has not been fully determined.

The reverse has a window filled with loosely plaited hair, which is dark so may not have belonged to the sitter.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"When the grass in camp is eaten up by the animals, &amp; the Buffalo all driven off by repeated foays amongst them, the Indian must then per force break up his encampment.  His natural indolence is averse to the movement, but stern necessity that rules her childrem with an iron rod drives him into the measure;- nothing short of an Indian yell, that dreadful gage to battle (once heard, never to be forgotten), can rouse him to his wonted activity.  Now, however, he must leave his dolce far niente, his solacing campfire, pack up his moveables and go." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"The scene represents a rolling prairie, and this is always unfavorable to the Buffalo;- To urge his huge weight up hill is to him not a labor of love.  Heis here at bay, and has fallen at the top of the hill;- wounded, but by no means vanquished.  The Indians in the meantime are racing round about tantalizing and menacing him,- flutterine a red cloth, and yelling at the top of their lungs.  He bellows from impotent rage, rises on his fee, stamps the ground, flings the earth all around him, and then makes a dash at the nearest,- being perfectly familiar with the habits of the animal, they are quite prepared for this, and genrally stampede follows,- the attack is renewed as soon as he stops;- until exhausted with weakness and loss of blood, he falls again and is dispatched with spears or arrows.  At times they require a good deal of killing - being very tenacious of life."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"Daylight still lingers on the horizon, but the moon gives light.  The Camp is belated, and a successful effort has been made to coss the river,- it being shallow enough to pass the vehicles without injury to the goods they contain.  On arriving at the banks of a river, late or otherwise, a crossing is effected (if possible) so as to start early on the following morning;- our purveyors are bustling to provide a supper for these hungry men, the evening meal being the most lively of any;- the work for the day being finished, they are at leisure;- the incidents thereto are brought forward, commented upon and criticized; the hunters relate their adventures among the 'varmint.' the greenhorn listens, &amp; wishes 'That heaven had made him such a man.' If not too tired the Canadians get up for a dance, while others chaunt or play the tune.  Last scene of all the mountaineers is streched out with 'his back to the earth, his feet to the fire.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Waist-length, three-quarter profile portrait of a man with wavy brown hair parted on the left, and side whiskers, wearing a black coat, white shirt, high white collar and white stock. The miniature is mounted in a gold, oval frame, with a braid of hair under glass on the reverse.

The sitter may be Robert Eden Handy, a businessman and soldier, who was born in Pennsylvania and in 1834 moved to Texas where he established a real estate partnership with William Lusk. They became joint founders of Richmond, Texas. During the Texas Revolution Handy served briefly on Sam Houston's staff and fought at the battle of San Jacinto. He died in late 1837.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Easterners first experienced the Rocky Mountains through Miller's landscape paintings. Finding it difficult to convey the scenery's vastness, Miller strove to live up to his own descriptions: "...huge masses of rock are piled one upon another lifting themselves skyward," he wrote. "At the base in the water lies a monstrous boulder, brought down (no doubt) centuries past, in one of [nature's]... convulsive fits; beyond this a bluff covered with stunted vegetation pushes boldly out of the lake... farther off the mountains continue to rise until they reach the region of eternal snow." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The Buffalo has been wounded in the flank,- he is not disabled, not at all desirous of giving up the contest,- on the contrary he is ripe for mischief,- full of rage, and is making savage onslaughts on his enemies who are on their part tantalizing him in every manner with feints, mock attackes, and general bagatelle, - retreating as he gives battle, and barely escaping some of his awkward plunges.  One has apporached and flung a lasso, with the intention of throwing him down;- they keep up this "fun" until the poor creature is nearly exhausted, and then dispatch him.  It is this pluck on the part of the Buffalo that commands the admiration of the savage;- he will fight until he cannot stand on his feet.  A flank tending to bring out all his energies &amp; game qualities." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Richards was a Philadelphia artist who was known for his meticulously faithful rendering of nature inspired by the writings of the influential critic John Ruskin. Ruskin's influence can be seen on Richards' work from 1858; this work is dated 5 July 1859 and is therefore an early example. The artist's initials can be seen carved into the bark of the tree in the background.

William T. Walters owned a oil by Richards title "Tulip Trees" executed in the same year, however, he sold this work in around 1861 when he relocated to Paris at the time of the Civil War. At this time Walters shifted his collecting activity from American to European art. "Tulip Trees" is now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>It is true that various Plains Indians would occasionally chase buffalo over a small cliff, but Miller probably never saw this scene and therefore exaggerated it a bit.  The Indians, when they found a suitable bluff, would conceal themselves behind the rocks with hides.  When the herd would start to move towards the bluff, the Indians would jump up from behind their rocks, shouting and waving the hides, keeping the buffalo moving toward the cliff.  In later versions of this picture, Miller exaggerated the cliff even more.  Had the Indians driven buffalo over such precipices, the meat would have been too badly smashed to eat and the bones would have been broken.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Sonntag depicted idealized views of nature not yet affected by human development. This work dates from early in his career, when he was exploring the Potomac and Ohio Rivers for subjects.

Sonntag began his career as a traveling landscape painter working in the Midwest. In 1846, after receiving a contract from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to record the landscapes along the rail routes, he began to enjoy a growing clientele. With the proceeds from his sales, he traveled abroad, visiting Italy in 1853 and again in 1855. In Sonntag's later works, the rendering of light and atmosphere becomes subtler, reflecting an awareness of trends in contemporary European painting.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In this pastel, Cassatt portrays the 12-year-old son of her friend and art consultant Dikran Kelekian. From 1866 to 1870, Cassatt studied in Paris with such masters as Jean-Léon Gérôme and Thomas Couture, but, becoming aware of the works of Gustave Courbet and Edgar Degas, she broke with the academic traditions. In 1879, when she had developed a fully impressionistic style, Degas invited her to participate in the 4th impressionist exhibition. At that time, she also began to produce major works in pastel, drawing with remarkably vigorous and intense strokes.

    <PublicDescription>"The hunters have here encountered a large band of Elk, and are sallying out from their ambush to shoot them as they pass.  At certain seasons it is quite usual to find them in herds of severl hundreds coming down from the mountains and flying en masse over the plain to reach the vicinity of streams or rivers." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>General John Barker (ca. 1746-1818) was a soldier and politician of prominence in early Philadelphia who served as alderman, as Major-General of the Pennsylvania militia, and finally as Mayor of Philadelphia in 1808 and 1812.

William Russell Birch studied in London. Sir Joshua Reynolds, the leading British portrait painter of his day, commissioned Birch to make small enamel copies of his oil paintings to preserve a record of their colors in case the paintings faded. In 1794 Birch and his family emigrated to Philadelphia, then the capital and largest and wealthiest city in America. Birch brought with him a letter of recommendation from Benjamin West, and he soon set up shop painting enamel miniatures. Enamel was the favored medium for minuitures in England from ca. 1630 into the 18th century. Birch was the most acclaimed American miniaturists working in enamel.

Archival photographs show this portrait and its companion piece in conventional nineteenth-century frames, now lost, suggesting they were once displayed hanging on a wall.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Boughton was the son of a Norwich farmer who was taken to America while still an infant. He initially opened a studio in Albany, New York, listing himself as a landscape painter. He eventually settled in London where he produced historical genre scenes, many of which were set in New England. This painting is set in the English Regency period. A young couple is seated at the fork of diverging paths. As noted by the artist, this is an ominous sign for their furture:

"A young pair are seated under a tree- late autumn, the big leaves all about- he is reading a book and carelessly caressing his dog; and she is pouting prettily, but thinking no pretty thoughts of him. (Excerpt from a now unlocated letter from Boughton to W. T. Walters reproduced in the early Walters catalogues).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The hunters have detached a buffalo from the main band, wounded him, and he is down on his haunches, by no means conquered - He is gathering up his energies for a final struggle with his unrelenting pursuers - hunters and horses both being on the alert, keeping a chary distance and watchful eye.  Once more on his feet, his onset from his great weight (abotu 2,500 pounds) is terrible, but he strikes now, as the boxers have it, 'all abroad,' being blinded with rage and pain.  All will not do, the cunning of man is too much for him,- while he is furiously attacking on party, another with a well-aimed ball strikes a fatal part, which brings him heavily down, bellowing loud enough to wake Morpheus himself - his defian eye galring to the last, and seemingly to ask no quarter.  In the middle the retreaters are chasing the retreating band, it is impossible to resist the excitement, and all go in pell-mell.  A portion of the Wind River shain of mountains looms up in the distance - the tops covered with snow wo dazzling that they eye can scarcely bear its brilliancy." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The subject of this portrait by Miller is Mrs. Jesse Hare (Catherine H. Welch) (ca. 1790-1874). She was born in Lynchburg, Virginia and also died there. On 11 October 1810 she married Jesse Hare (1789-1861) in Baltimore. Hare was an extremely wealthy tobacco manufacturer. She lived with her daughter, Eliza Credilla Hare, who, on her married in 1847 became Mrs. Decatur Howard Miller and sister-in-law to the artist. On 1 September 1848 A.J. Miller recieved a hundred dollars from his brother for his mother-in-law's portrait. Miller also painted the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Howard Miller, which are now also owned by the museum (see WAM 37.2557 and WAM 37.2558).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Charles Fraser was a painter of miniatures, portraits in oils and landscapes. He spent most of his life in his native city of Charleston depicting its leading citizens. This portrait shows a woman in a white bonnet wearing a black dress and a blue shawl. She is named as Mrs. Elizabeth Belin. The sitter does not appear in Fraser's account book, but it dates from a year not included in that volume, it was however included in the 1857 solo exhibition of Fraser's work as catalogue no. 173 (Mrs. E. Belin). She was perhaps the wife or relative of Allard Belin, who is listed in the preceeding record in the same catalog (no. 172).

The miniature is in a case which recalls the cases made for daguerreotype photographs, although in fact these were adapted from traveling cases for miniatures.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>It took Heade several decades to arrive at the mature landscape style for which he is now admired. Initially trained in the studio of sign-painter Edward Hicks, Heade traveled constantly during his early career, both in Europe and America, and was probably most influenced by the art of Frederic Edwin Church. Eventually, he developed his own, unique approach to his landscape motifs, adopting an unusually broad format that allowed him to emphasize the drama of wide vistas like this one.

Unlike the artists associated with the Hudson River school of American landscape painting, Heade was fascinated with the momentary as opposed to the eternal, often painting from nature in an attempt to capture the ever-changing conditions of light and atmosphere. In this sense, he anticipated the preoccupations of the impressionists.

This painting depicts the salt marshes at Newburyport, Massachusetts. It dates to Heade's earliest experiments with what would become a favorite format and subject matter.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Educated as a lawyer at Brown and Harvard Universities, Hoppin practiced his profession in his native Providence, Rhode Island, before becoming an illustrator. He generally specialized in humorous subjects, although he also illustrated travel books.

This drawing may have been inspired by George Pope Morris's popular poem of the same title. The last verse of which reads:
"My lady waits! – No fairer flower / E'er deck'd the floral grove, / Than she, the pride of hall and bower, / The lady of my love! / The eastern hills are flecked with light, / The land-breeze curls the sea! / By love and truth sustained, for flight, / My lady waits for me. / My lady waits – for me she waits, / While morning opes her golden gates."

    <PublicDescription>Tiffany was the foremost American exponent of the Art Nouveau movement, which rejected historical styles and called for a re-examination of vegetal and zoological motifs, particularly as seen in Japanese art. He developed it into a sensuous, organic style. The Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, founded in Corona, New York, in 1892, was particularly known for its "Favrile" glass, which imitated the iridescent sheen that ancient Roman glass acquired after being buried for centuries.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Burroughs was a painter and museum curator. He studied at the Art Students League in New York City and the Académie Julian in Paris with J.P. Laurens. He was curator of paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a painter he favored classical subjects given a modern twist, such as this painting of Helen of Troy making herself up at a very modern looking dressing-table while Troy burns in the background. Given that this painting is dated 1914, the year war broke out in Europe, the painting could also be read satirically.

The Walters Art Museum owns several works by the artist including a series of 20 oil sketches. Some were acquired by Henry Walters while other were gifted to the museum by of Burroughs' second wife, Louise, a writer and curator.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>John William Hill was born in London in 1812, the son of engraver John Hill. His family followed his father to Philadelphia in 1819 and then moved four years later to New York, where he was apprenticed to his father for the next seven years. Hill served as a topographical artist for the New York State Geological Survey from 1836 to 1841 and provided illustrations for natural history publications from 1842 on. In 1855, on one a trip to prepare a series of views of major North American cities he read John Ruskin's "Modern Painters." Ruskin's ideas significantly changed Hill's direction. 

Given the lack of a concrete date for this work, it is unclear whether it dates from the period after he read "Modern Painters" or is related to his botanical work.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>By the time Miller saw the fur trade, several famous personalities were involved, such as Jim Bridger, "Bourgeois" Walker, and Kit Carson.  Of that group, it is interesting to note, Miller painted a portrait only of Walker.  There are various other portraits of members of Stewart's group, such as Pierre, a seventeen-year old French Canadian and one of Miller's favorites.  Dressed here in his buckskin shirt, his hat decorated with turkey feathers and a fox-tail brush, and holding his treasured pipe, Pierre is apparently deep in thought.  -Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The point of view here is some 40 or 50 miles from the mountains, whose summits are seen reflecting the light from the sun.  In the immediate foreground are some Indian Lodges, with a chief and his satellites watching the return of a party who have been sent out on a marauding expedition, and are seen coming up the defile.  The source of this river is in the vicinity of the South Pass, and ultimately finds its way to the Platte; before doing so, however, it passes through the famous Canon (Kanyon) called the 'Devil's Gate' of which a sketch will be forthcoming.  From Fort Laramie along the Platte we had seen almost daily the Magpie, a large sprightly bird, long tailed, with plumage white and jet black,- it is never seen (we believe) in the States.  The Cactus plant was also abundant, bearing large rich flowers, scarlet and white;- on the Eau Sucre it is less frequent.  Dwarf trees, bearing excellent plums, were to be found occasionally, not to be despied by men, whose only change of diet was coffee and meat at breakfast;- meat and coffee at noon;- and da copo at night." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>While leaving camp, Miller and his caravan were met by a group of Indians coming at full gallop towards them.  Frightened, they were not sure what to do.  When approached, Miller describes the action, "We stopped the camp and held a parley.  Their argument was capital.  They were on their own grounds, and we were 'interlopers' - winding up with a demand for black-mail on the instant.  The great point was to get the chiefs and leaders to smoking as soon as possible, so as to gain diplomatic time.  The famous maxim of Larochefoncault [La Rochefoucauld] will apply to the Indians with truth, however we may object to it in civilized life;- 'In the misfortunes of our friends, we always find something not displeasing to us.'  At last we got the chiefs seated in the council circle, and the pip circulating, each taking a few whiffs.  The first two with much ceremony, and muttering to the sun for the Great Spirit, and the next to the earth."   A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"Hunters are in full tilt after the most formidable of all animals met within the journey [the Grizzly bear]. It is no child's play, but downright dangerous sport.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"The scene represented in the sketch is on the "Big Sandy" near Green River, on the Banks of which some Beaver Trappers are about to encamp in pursuit of their game.  To show the callousness of these men, a traveller mentions a ludicrous incident of his camp: - One night while a violent storm was raging and the rain pouring with Niagara sluice, he heard one of his men singing at the fire; he had the curiosity to go and see who it was,- it was a man sitting crosslegged in Indian fashion, with his hands over the expiring ashes.  His features pinched with cold, and lank and thin, wore a comically serious expression as the electric flashes lighted them up;- the rain streaming from his nose &amp; prominent chin, &amp; his hunting shirt hanging about him in a flabby &amp; soaking embrace;- spite of such a situation which was anything but cheering, he was rapping out at the top of his voice a ditty, the chorus or refrain of which was, &amp; which he gave with peculiar emphasis:- 'How happy am I!/ From care I'm free:/ Oh, why are not all/ Contented like me?'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This view of a couple boating is characteristic of Bricher's paintings during the 1880s, when he was based at Lake George, New York. Although younger than Heade and Sonntag, Bricher shared their commitment to precise representation of the landscape in varying climatic conditions. 

Bricher began to paint in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and along the Maine and Massachusetts coastline. In 1869, he moved to New York City, where he pursued a successful career as a fashionable landscape artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The Commander, with his Indian guide and interpreter, has left the caravan on the plain and advanced to a 'butte' or bluff to reconnoiter, to see how the land lies, and interrogate the guide.  These guides are often picked up haphazard on the prairie, having sometimes their own projects in view.  From these elevated bluffs an extended view is had in all directions over the prairie, so that, with the aid of the compass, the hills and river courses, a pretty accurate testing of the guide's knowledge of the locality and his ability as pilot may be reached.  The conversation is carried on by signs when the interpreter is at fault, comprehensible enough for all useful purposes and readily understood." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The influential English author and critic John Ruskin profoundly influenced the Pre-Raphaelite painters in England as well as their contemporaries in America. He once wrote that the duty of the artist was "neither to choose, nor compose, nor imagine, nor experimentalize; but to be humble and earnest in following the steps of nature, and tracing the figure of God." At the beginning of the 1860s, a number of American artist responded by producing views of plants growing in their natural state.

Richards' first attempts at working from nature in the Ruskinian manner date from 1858 and this phase lasts until 1865. This watercolor, which is dated 1860, portrays nature at closer quarters than his initial attempts. It also shows his growing control of the medium, although he did not come to specialize in watercolor until a decade later. This work is an interesting comparison to WAM 37.2642 which was painted from studies in the studio. In this work Richards' handling of watercolor is much broader and his subject matter wild and romantic, recalling the work of J.M.W. Turner.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Waist-length portrait of Elizabeth Baynton Markoe (1807-1886), who married William Masters Camac in 1829. She is shown with straight black hair, parted in the center, wearing a low-cut red velvet dress with short sleeves trimmed with lace. She has one long strand of pearls around her neck, and a yellow scarf draped over her lower arms.

When the sitter's husband died in 1842 (he is portrayed in the pendant portrait-miniature WAM 38.469) Elizabeth was left a wealthy widow.  She lived on an estate four or five miles outside Philadelphia, which the landscape architect A.J. Downing praised, especially the conservatory and lawns. The house is illustrated in Downing's "Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North American" (2nd edition, 1844).

The frame is not original and is later than the portrait.</PublicDescription>

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>During the early 19th century, stickpins were a popular accessory worn by men as a tie or cravat pin. They came in a variety of precious materials and motifs. So as not to appear feminine, they frequently represented hunting, sporting, or other typically male pursuits. They were also crafted as mourning, commemorative, or souvenir pins.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch presents an almost Arcadian scene, the simple minds of the savages gives them no brighter heaven hereafter.  Their paradise is constructed with (at least) as much facility as a Persian... It is a question whether, with all our boasted civilization, we enjoy more real happiness than these children of the prairie, on whom we exhausted a deal of superfluous sympathy.  They would certainly not be willing or in a hurry to exchange with us; and are at least contented with their lot.  We (generally speaking) never are;- so that after toiling through pain and suffering for a life time, withough (rarely if ever) being able to accomplish the work before us, we go out of the world in about the same sort of stupid astonishment with which we came into it.  The scene is on the River Eau Sucre, two Indian women are seated on its borders, and in the distance an encampment.  In the immediate foreground is an Indian canoe, made of Birch-wood bark.  These boats are light and swift, are beautifully modelled; and reminded one much of the Gondolas of Venice."   A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Way was a Baltimore painter who began his career as a portraitist; but, on the advice of the influential Düsseldorf artist Emanuel Leutze (known for his famous work, "Washington Crossing the Delaware," in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), he turned to still lifes, specializing in such subjects as bunches of grapes and oysters. In Walters 37.1887 he depicts a bunch of grapes grown at the Walters' family country-house just outside Baltimore.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Though he frequently posed as a southern gentleman from Baltimore, Whistler was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, and, together with George A. Lucas (1824-1909), attended the West Point Military Academy. He later trained in Paris in the studio of Charles Gleyre, where he befriended the realists Gustave Courbet and Edouard Manet, as well as the future impressionists Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Henri Fantin-Latour. In 1859, Whistler moved to London, abandoned Realism, and developed his own tonalist style of painting that used muted colors and reflected the influences of Japanese art and of the art of Diego Velázquez (1599-1660).

In this portrait Whistler depicts Lucas, the Paris based art collector and agent who played a significant role in shaping the collection of William T. and Henry Walters. The handwritten note by Lucas attached to the back of the picture gives the length of the sitting as two days, on the 22 and 23 August 1886, at Lucas's country house at Boissise-la-Bertrand, near Paris.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller.

    <PublicDescription>Warren Delano III (1852-1920), Henry Walters' brother-in-law, served as vice president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. While surveying the railroad's land holdings on horseback, he was sometimes accompanied by his young nephew, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the future president. As indicated by the inscription in French, this miniature commemorates the 20th wedding anniversary of Warren and Jennie Delano (Henry's sister).

William Jacob Baer was born in Cincinnati in 1860, where he was trained in lithography. In 1880 he traveled to Munich to study drawing and painting at the Royal Academy. When he returned to the United States, he lived in New Jersey where he taught drawing and painting at Princeton University. In 1893 he moved to New York and where he first painted portrait miniatures; by 1894 he had given up easel painting all together to focus exclusively on this genre. He helped found the American Society of Miniature Painters, and is considered instrumental in the revival of miniature at the end of the 19th century. Baer exhibited both nationally and internationally, at the Exposition Universelle (1900), Pan-American Exposition (1901), Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904), and the Panama-Pacific Exposition (1915), where he work was well received. He seems to have found particular success with Henry Walters and his relatives. The Walters Art Museum holds six works on ivory by the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Pressed by the hunters after a hard run, the Elk almost dead beaten has as a last resource leaped into a stream too shallow for him to swim, and this seals his fate;- the hunters evidently thinking that nothing but gunpowder will save their bacon.  One is about to give him a Coup de Pistolet,- others are in the back ground, hurrying on with a ball in reserve if required.  In comparison with the deer and antelope this animal is a little sluggish, but has a most noble presence, often carrying ten antlers on his head, and is extremely graceful.  In size, about that of a large-sized mule.  In winter they congregate in large herds numbering several hundreds, and travel immense distances.  In season, the venison of the Elk, although coarser than the deer, is a capital addition to the larder." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller.

    <PublicDescription>Chartran, a portraitist who specialized in celebrities and historical subjects, enjoyed a remarkable following in both France and America at the turn of the century. Apart from his skill in presenting flattering images, Chartran was admired for his "tact and bright sociability" that made him a "favorite among foreigners to visit New York." 

Jennie Walters was the daughter of William Thompson Walters (1819-1894) and Ellen Harper Walters (1822-1862). She was raised by her father and in the course of her education attended school in Paris; St. Mary's Convent, Georgetown, and Harvard University. While in Cambridge she married Warren Delano. They lived in Orange, New Jersey, and later in New York. Mrs. Delano survived her husband by two years. 

The subject was short in stature and full in figure. She is shown voluminously clad, seated in three-quarters length wearing a double-layered dress, the outer being black tulle and lace and the inner white satin. Her sleeves are wide and ruffled and she wears a white lace "Bertha." Gazing directly at the viewer, left hand on her shoulder and right in her lap, she appears confident and self-assured.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"While at 'Rendezvous' we were summoned at intervals to see the Indians perform their dances, engage in ball play, and test their bows and skill in shooting at a mark, the subject of our present sketch.  In order to give free action, they throw off their robe, retaining a cloth around thier hips, which they ornament in various ways with feathers &amp;c.; sometimes a bull's tail is secured to the belt as if they thought nature had omitted this appendage;- and it is possible that Lord Monboddo founded his wild theory that people existed who had tails from some such savage trick as this.  The Lexicographer (Dr. Johnson) attacked the philosopher with great fury and put him to rout;- but not before the latter had made some converts.  To the left in the sketch is seated an arrow maker, busily engaged in preparing and pointeing shfts, made usually from the Cotton-wood tree, on account of its lightness, and being easily worked;- great care is taken in having the arrow well balanced, straight, and uniform thoughout;- as on this depends the directness of its flight and aim." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This is a portrait of the French tragic actor François Joseph Talma (1763–1826), friend of the painter Jacques-Louis David and Napoleon Bonaparte. It was originally housed in one of Williams T. Walters' many albums of drawings. The portrait was executed by Peale on his second visit to Paris in 1809-10. Four years later Peale opened a museum in Baltimore.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The artist's younger brother Decatur Howard Miller distinguished himself as a leader of the Baltimore business community. As a young man, he entered the tobacco business of Jacob Heald and eventually succeeded his employer as head of the firm. He continued to direct the business in his own name until 1880. Miller also served as director of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Baltimore Dry Dock Company, the Consolidation Coal Company, and the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company, which operated ships along the northeastern Atlantic coast. He was at one point a member of the city council and vice-president of the Board of Trade (1875-1876).

D. H. Miller appears to have assumed responsibility for the financial affairs of his brothers and sisters, and it was probably his astuteness as an investor that led to the artist's financial independence.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>One of Miller's early sketches prepared for the Scottish adventurer and aristocrat Sir William Drummond Stewart, this picture has its origin in a drawing the artist made of Black Harris, a trapper, and his brother escaping from the Blackfeet. Miller noted that Harris "always created a sensation at the camp fire" with his dramatic story of the escape. Here Miller depicted Stewart in Harris' place. As Miller noted, stories such as this made a "prime after dinner story for England."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This painting was commissioned by William T. Walters in 1858, when the 62-year-old Durand was at the height of his fame and technical skill. The vertical format of the composition was a trademark of the artist, allowing him to exploit the grandeur of the sycamore trees as a means of framing the expansive landscape beyond.

Durand's approach to the "sublime landscape" was modeled on that of Thomas Cole (1801-48), founder of the Hudson River school of painting. The painters of this school explored the countryside of the eastern United States, particularly the Adirondack Mountains and the Catskills. Their paintings often reflect the Transcendental philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82), who believed that all of nature bore testimony to a spiritual truth that could be understood through personal intuition.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The tourist who jouneys to Europe in search of a new sensation, bust by this time find that his vocation is nearly gone.  Italy and its wonders have been described so often that they begin to pale.  Egypt, the River Nile, Cairo, and the pyramids have been 'done' to death.  Greece and her antiquities are as familiar as huosehold words.  What will the enterprising traveller do under these untoward circumstances? Well, here is a new field for him.  These mountain Lakes have been waiting for him thousands of years, and could afford to wait thousands of years longer, for they are now as fresh and beautiful as if just from the hands of the Creator.  In all pobability, when wer saw them not 20 white men had ever stood on their borders,  A single Lake and Mont Blanc are the wonders of Europe, but here are mountains and lakes reaching from Tehuantepec to the Frozen Ocean in the North, or upwards of 50 degrees - nearly one seventh part of the globe - ample room and verge enough, one would think, for a legion of tourists." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Tiffany was the foremost American exponent of the Art Nouveau movement, which rejected historical styles and called for a re-examination of vegetal and zoological motifs, particularly as seen in Japanese art. He developed it into a sensuous, organic style. The Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, founded in Corona, New York, in 1892, was particularly known for its "Favrile" glass, which imitated the iridescent sheen that ancient Roman glass acquired after being buried for centuries. This vase is thought to have been engraved by Fredolin Kreischmann.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The sitter in this miniature has been identified as Colonel Samuel Waldo (1721-1770) who graduated from Harvard College in 1743. He was a member of the General Court and Colonel in the British Army in 1744, and became a Judge of the Probate Court in 1760. However, the age of the sitter does not seem to tally with the proposed date of this portrait, nor does the attribution of the miniature to Copley seem secure.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The grapes in this painting have been identified as the Prince Albert variety, which William T. Walters grew at his Govans estate, Saint Mary's. Way was a Baltimore painter who began his career as a portraitist; but, on the advice of the influential Düsseldorf artist Emanuel Leutze (known for his famous work, "Washington Crossing the Delaware," in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), he turned to still lifes, specializing in such subjects as bunches of grapes and oysters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Trappers are divided into three classes, - the hired, the free, and the trapper 'on his own hook.' ... On starting for the hunt the trapper fits himself out with full equipment. In addition to his animals he procures 5 or 6 traps (usually carried in a trap-sack), ammunition, a few pounds of tobacco, a supply of moccasins, a wallet called a 'possible sack,' gun, bowie knife, and sometimes a tomahawk. Over his left shoulder and under his right arm hang his buffalo powder-horn, a bullet pouch in which he carries balls, flint, and steel, with other knick-knacks. ... Encircled with danger, they wander far and near in pursuit of 'sign' of beaver. Ever on the alert, a turned leaf, grass pressed down, or the uneasiness of his animals, are palpable to him of proximity to an Indian foe, and places him on his guard," A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>A chronometer is a navigational tool consisting of an extremely accurate timepiece that can be used to keep Greenwich Mean Time. Longitude can then be calculated by computing the difference between the chronometer's mean time and the ship's local time, measured against the position of celestial bodies.

This chronometer, used on Henry Walters' steamyacht, the Narada, was made by George P. Kullberg in London, who was famed for the precision of his manufacturers. Based on the serial number of the movement, it was made some time in 1898 or 1899 (after Henry acquired the yacht from Anthony Joseph Drexel Jr.), and finished with a dial, box and other fittings by John Bliss and Co. of New York City. The object then fit within an outer box (WAM 58.266B), that was secured to the bridge of the yacht.

    <PublicDescription>A young woman stares longingly at a portrait miniature of a loved one who is absent.

Although born in London to American parents, Leslie was raised in Philadelphia.  At the age of 17, he returned to London, where he studied with the American artists Benjamin West and Washington Allston.  Except for several months in 1833 when he served as a professor at the United States Military Academy, he pursued a successful career in London as a painter of theatrical and modern historical subjects.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Palmer, who was self-taught, was among the first American sculptors to break with the prevailing neoclassical style and adopt a more naturalistic approach.

A version of this bust (likely in plaster or clay) was first exhibitied in New York in 1856, and a first marble version made soon after. The sculptor's account book shows that William T. Walters payed $600 for a second marble version of this work in 1858. It appears that four were made in this medium, the final being cut in 1871.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Founded by William Sublette and Robert Campbell, Fort Laramie lay at the crossroads of an old north-south Indian trail and what became known as the Oregon Trail. Called Fort Laramie because of the nearby Laramie Mountains and the Laramie Fork of the North Platte River, the post was approximately 150 feet square, according to Miller, with bastions at the diagonal corners. Miller's paintings are the only known visual records of the fort, because the original fort was torn down in 1840 before any other artist had traveled the Oregon Trail; it was replaced with another structure, located perhaps on the same site in 1841. -Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The Indians of North America have no further knowledge of Astronomy than perhaps to point out the North or Polar star, by which they travel at night;- their knowledge of Geography is also very limited, yet they draw with tolerable accuracy charts of places visited by them.  They  show an amazing facility in tracing the passage of a man or beast, either over leaves, grass, or the earth, and describe accurately from foot-prints, ruts, and other impressions left on the ground (if recent) how many persons, the number of horses or mules, the number of lodges, whether whites or Indians and numberous other particulars, with a certainty and decision most remarkable.  This wonderful power can only be attained by close attention, unwearied patience, and long experience.  The subject of the skethc is a Snake Indian describing from certain marks on the ground, the particulars of a party who have passed in advance."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>This monumental sideboard represents a style of furniture that was popular in the 1850s, after the exhibition of a similar piece at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. The sideboard was part of a dining-room suite that William T. Walters commissioned through a local furniture maker, likely around the time of his purchase of a large townhouse in Mount Vernon Place, Baltimore in 1857. The carving of the dead game animals is characteristic of the work of German artisans active in this country.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The foreground presents a high bluff, where our Leader is engaged in conciliating some chiefs by making them presents, and smoking the Calumet.  A carpet has been spread, and the chief is presenting a pipe already lighted;- this has a universal meaning amonst them, and signifies freidnship and good will.  Trappers are lazily lying about.- watching the animated scene on the prairie below, or mayhap gazing vacantly - while thinking of their humble homes in old 'Mis-sou-rye.' On the broad prairie beneath, bright Indian Lodges are scattered over the plain until they reach the mountain steeps.  The natives are in groups engaged in their games &amp; pastimes,- while some are breathing their horses, others are trafficking - ball playing &amp;c.  The great chain called the 'Mountain of Winds' closes the scene." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The amusements of these young girls is very limited - riding horses, when they can get them, swimming in the streams, which they can do like ducks, and playing with the dog. Fashion does not trouble their simple little heads, as is the case with their civilized sisters. Their dresses are not for the season but for all time, and as Nature has blessed them with a luxuriant supply of black hair, what do they want with a bonnet?" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Having searched around the stream for "sign" of beavers- such as footprints in the mud or sand, these trappers are in the process of setting their five pound traps in beds they had dug with their knives. Each trap was tied firmly to a tree or a pole as well as a float stick that was hammered into the mud to the beaver could not carry off the trap.

The trappers travel in pairs because of the continual threat of Indian attack.  Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Young boys from the Savoy region of Italy who made their living as street musicians and chimney sweeps were popular subjects among European artists in the nineteenth century. They are often represented as ragged but sensual figures. In Woodville's painting, a young boy in worn clothing rests on a stone balustrade, holding his instrument and gazing out from under hooded eyes. The background is a crumbling wall exposing a brick underlayer. The gargoyle over the boy's shoulder is a menacing presence to the boy's independence and a lewd pendant to his self-assured and seductive gaze. The boy's left hand is worked in the tiny brushstrokes and rich detail associated with this artist, down to the dirt under the thumbnail. At the same time, the right hand holding the instrument is clearly unfinished. The hurdy-gurdy so central to the composition, which the artist added at a late stage, was developed in the medieval period and popular in the Renaissance. It produces sound with a crank-turned rosined wheel rubbing against strings, and by Woodville's time, was associated with street musicians. 

Dated 1853, this work is singular in the artist's oeuvre. The larger canvas size, the loose brushwork and monochromatic palette, the individual subject with one accessory, all depart from the multifigured narratives filled with carefully rendered details seen in the rest of his work. We know very little about Woodville's life in general and the years he spent in Paris and London from 1851 to 1855 in particular. He no longer had the ready outlet of the American Art-Union, which was disbanded in 1851. He may have been experimenting with the popular subject of a single musician with an instrument after seeing the success of his Art-Union compatriot William Sidney Mount's prints of African-American banjo and bone players for Goupil &amp; Co. Woodville's American colleague Eastman Johnson, with whom he had been acquainted in Düsseldorf, painted four versions of Savoyard subjects during his time in The Hague. Johnson's Savoyard Boy of 1853 is similar in the limited, earthy palette of its background and the precise depiction of the figure.

The artist's brother William Woodville VI mentions this work as belonging to the widow of his brother Myddleton Lloyd Woodville. It was discovered in Baltimore in an attic storeroom at the Maryland Club at Charles and Eager Streets, where Myddleton, who lived in Philadelphia, may have kept a room.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>In this small half-length self-portrait, Woodville fashions himself as a privileged urban gentleman, in a formal black coat, white shirt with wing collar, and a black bow tie. He has the smooth, broad forehead that contemporaries associated with superior intelligence and virtue; indeed, artist Chester Harding, who founded and guided the Boston Artists Association in the 1840s, was known to have told an aspiring painter he could never succeed "because his head was not big enough." Woodville fixes a penetrating, arrogant gaze on the viewer, embodying the elite social world in which he was raised and which he left behind in choosing the life of an artist. 

Woodville studied as a private pupil of figure and portrait specialist Carl Friedrich Sohn and throughout his career showed a remarkable capacity for sophisticated depiction of character. The artistic community in which he lived in Düsseldorf was notable for the production of Freundschaftsgalerien, large friendship pictures that gathered small portraits of individual artists. Although none of the American artists were included in these assemblages, Woodville's friend Leutze was a member of the social club known as Malkasten or "Paint Box," where the same artists gathered to eat, socialize, and hold amateur theatrics. Both this self-portrait and the Self-Portrait with Flowered Wallpaper are sophisticated bids at self-representation, which the artist retained in his possession. The painting descended in the family of the artist's second marriage and concealed beneath its canvas an unfinished Portrait of a Woman, that is a likely image of his first wife.

    <PublicDescription>This book of hours was written in German in Vienna, Austria, ca. 1460-65. It is one of a series of manuscripts commissioned at the court of Emperor Frederick III of Austria (1415-1493), some of which were made for his son, Prince Maximilian (1459-1519). The name of the artist is unknown, but due to his connection with these commissions, he is known as the Master of the Maximilian Schoolbooks. Unfortunately, only three of the original sixteen full-page, richly painted miniatures remain in this manuscript, but ten of the missing folios have been identified. Nine cuttings are in the Musee Bonnat, Bayonne, France (inv. nr. 1244-1252), and one cutting is in the Cleveland Museum of Art (Dudley P. Allen Fund Accession 1959.40). Other related manuscripts include Vienna, Nationalbibliothek Codicies 2368, 2617, and 2289.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"It becomes a matter indispensable at times that a communication should take place with a different tribe, either as preliminary to a treaty, to form a truce, or a proposal to bury the hatchet and smoke the pipe of peace;- the tribe proposing this last remedy, you may always rest assured, has had the worst of the matter in battle.  An Indian runner is selected, noted for craftiness and cunning, who is straightway dispatched on the delicate mission.  Coming in sight of the belligerent or rival camp, he does not at once enter their villiage, but seats himself within sight, and here remains patiently until a deputation is sent out to meet him.  During the time of waiting, he does not know whether his reception will be friendly, or whether they will lead him to the stake for torture.  If the last mentioned should be decided on, he at once braces himself up, and meets his fate in a manner that would shame any Christian, for faith in his own belief, and fortitude under suffering,- he sings his song of defiance, and dies exulting." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In the foreground of the sketch is an Indian en grande parure, armed with a bow, spear &amp; targe,- he takes as much care to dress himself for war as a civilized man for a bridal party or ball.  To the right of him is a Lodge near the base of which are represented some blood-red hands, these emblems are significant and are produced by dipping their hands in red ochre, and forming them by pressure.  Some fishing canoes are seen in the distance.  General Clark (one of the pioneers among the Indians), whom I visited frequently in St. Louis, stated some curious facts as regards the acuteness and sagacity of the Indian that are worth noting.  For example, they will start on a journey for over 100 miles, either through forests or over a plain and reach their destination without any material deviation from a straight line; &amp; it will make no difference in the result whether the sun shines or is obscured by clouds.  In the same manner they will point out the place of the latter though it may be intercepted by thick clouds or fogs.  They will also trace their enemy or game on leaves or grass with such unerring purpose that it is almost impossible that either should escape.  Nothing but long experience and great attention, with close observation, could confer on them a power of this kind." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>In an interview with a critic for the Baltimore Sun in 1907, the artist noted: "Extreme realism, then, is when we say too much; extreme impressionism is when we say too little. But to say just the right thing at the right time and in the right way is as desirable in the art of picturemaking as in society."

This drawing and two accompanying works (WAM 37.2584 and WAM 37.2582) in pencil and gouache were made by the artist in preparation for a painting showing a regatta held on the Grand Canal in May, 1902.

Smith was born on St. Paul Street, Baltimore. He trained initially as an engineer but later taught himself to paint in watercolors. He traveled extensively, producing watercolors which were reproduced in deluxe "travel books," such as "Gondola Days" (1897) and "The Venice of To-Day" (1897) as well as various magazines. He was also the author of many popular books.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Brown was already an accomplished portrait painter when he emigrated from England to the United States in 1853. He established himself as a genre painter in New York, specializing in sentimental or humorous scenes that often involved children.

Although he usually depicted underprivileged individuals, in this instance he shows subjects who clearly live in comfortable, middle-class circumstances.

This work was formerly housed in one of William T. Walters' drawings albums.

    <PublicDescription>This drawing by Miller shows a small, simple house nestled among hills and trees. The sketch is labeled "Scene near Greenmount" which is a cemetery in Baltimore established in 1838.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The traveller on his way to the South pass of the Rocky Mountains encounters this singular scene, about 5 miles beyone Independence Rock, where the Sweet Water has forced its way through a granite ridge.  Col. Frémont, who seems to have measured it, thus decribed it.- 'The length of the passage is about 300 yards, and the width 35 yards.  The walls of rock are verticle, and about 400 feet in height; and the stream in the gate is almost entirely choked up by masses which have fallen from above.  In the wall on the right back is a dike of trap rock, cutting though a fine grey granite; near the point of the ridge crop out some Starta of the valley formation, consisting of a greyish sandstone and fine grey conglomerate and marl.' The sketch however will convey a better idea of the scene than any written description can possibly accomplish." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Mourning miniatures were very popular in the Romantic period and this design is typical for the late 18th and early 19th century. A classically dressed woman lays a wreath on an urn atop a tomb. The inscription on the tomb reads, "In memory of Geo. Chambers." In the background is a willow tree, associated with both mourning and new life. Almost monochrome, there are touches of pink on the woman's face and hands. On the back of the miniature is a panel of woven hair, and the monogram in pressed gold "EC," suggesting that this miniature by have been reworked to commemorate another family member as well as George. This miniature was gifted to the museum in a silk-lined red leather case.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Frederick Edwin Church studied landscape painting under Thomas Cole, a member of the Hudson River School.  Church's unique approach to landscape painting aimed to give the viewer a window onto the beauty of the Americas.  He combined precise botanical and geological observation with romanticism, drawing insight and direction from the scientist Alexander von Humboldt. Church wrote in a letter to Erasmus Palmer that Humboldt was able to "share the pleasure which a sensitive and contemplative spirit experiences in the presence of the creation… to make him feel more vividly the harmony of the physical forces." (Letter to Erasmus Palmer, July 7, 1869).

The scene was probably taken from Ecuador or Colombia and would appear to refer to Church's trip to South America in 1857, two years before the date of this drawing (he also traveled there in 1853). It was formerly housed in one of William T. Walters' drawings albums.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Waist-length, almost full-view portrait of a young woman with black, straight hair parted in the center. She wears a white shirt with high collar and blue brooch at her throat, with a blue velvet scarf draped over her right arm. The back of a dark red velvet chair is visible at right shoulder.

Harriet Aymar may have been born Harriet Attwood Downe, who married John Daniel Aymar in 1849, the year this miniature was painted, and appears to have been born in 1831 in Stafford, New Hampshire (making her 18 year old at the time this miniature was painted). However, at the time of writing there is no conlusive proof that this is the same Harriet Aymar as is portrayed here. John Daniel Aymar lived in New York, where the artist also practiced, perhaps giving further circumstantial evidence to the identification of the sitter as his wife, Harriet. Harriet was an only child, so it is possible that the miniature was made for her parents.

Henry Colton Shumway began studying at the Academy of Design in New York City at the age of twenty-one. By 1831, he had established himself as a reputable painter, exhibiting his work and taking commissions from prominent figures such as Governor John Trumbull, Daniel Webster, and Henry Clay. During Shumway's early years as an artist, his paintings sold for ten dollars, a small fee compared to the three hundred dollars he charged during the height of his career. With the increasing popularity of photography in the 1860s, Shumway, like many artists of the time, abandoned miniature painting to produce hand-colored daguerreotypes.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>An 18th-century Chinese porcelain vase, reputed to be the finest of its kind, was sold for $18,000 at the auction of the Mary J. Morgan estate in 1886 in New York. So controversial was the price that William T. Walters never admitted to being the purchaser. Almost immediately, replicas of the vase, like this one, appeared in glass and ceramic. Known as "Peach Blow" vases, the glass versions were made with layered glass-red to yellow on the exterior and milky white inside.

    <PublicDescription>"At four o'clock in the morning, it is the duty of the last men on guard to loosen the horses from their pickets, in order to range and feed.  At daylight, everybody is up;- our provisors are busy with preparations for breakfast;- tents and lodges are collapsed, suddenly thrown down, wrapped up, and bundled into the wagons.  If the sun is 20 minutes above the horizon when our breakfast is finished, we conceive he has a reproachful look.  By this time the horses are driven in, and each man hurries after his own, saddles or harnesses him, and the train puts itself en route." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Before entering the collections of the Walters Art Museum, this watercolor had last been publically exhibited at the Sargent memorial exhibition at the Royal Academy, London in 1926. Sargent was probably the most distinguished late 19th-century artist of American descent. This watercolor is one of the artist's earliest. Sargent would win particular renown for working in this medium in the last two decades of his life. The Walter's watercolor is presumed to have been painted in the fall of 1870 during Sargent's second trip to Spain. The journey, which was motivated by the young artist's desire to study the paintings of Velasquez, resulted in the production of some of his early masterpieces, most notably the celebrated "El Jaleo" (1882), a painting of a Spanish dancer now in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston. 

The subject of the Walter's picture is a vase in the Garden of the Andarves in the Alhambra Palace, placed there in the reign of Muhammad V (1354-91). For over four centuries the Alhambra vases were objects of admiration for travelers because of their marvelous cobalt blue and golden lustre and their unusual size. In 17th century accounts there were at least three vases, but by the time Sargent visited only one was intact. This is now in the Museo Arqueologico de la Alhambra. Although painted with considerable freedom, Sargent's watercolor is an accurate rendering, showing the antelope and tree-of-life motifs and even the puddle of glaze on the collar of the vessel. 

The Walters does not possess a vase similar to this, however, there is a fragmentary example in the Freer-Sackler Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., which was discovered by the Spanish painter, Mariano Fortuny, in a tavern of the Albaicín, Granada.

    <PublicDescription>"These Indians have placed themselves on a Bluff, for 2 purposes, - one to watch the horses and mules, to see they they do not stray beyond certain boundaries, - the other (still more important) is to give notice in case of the approach of hostile Indians. Horses to them are invaluable, and the first object of the invaders is to create a stampede amongst them. They sometimes hobble their animals, in order most effectually to prevent their running. The hobble is made of a band of strong leather and buckled around the forelegs, so that even in feeding they have to leap awkwardly in changing ground. These bluffs are admirable stations for sentinels, and command a vast distance over the prairie; besides, like sailors at sea, an Indian with descry an approaching horseman long before a white man can, without he has been a long time living amongst them." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"Black Harris and his brother Trapper are here making their escape from the terrible Blackfeet, the bete noires of the Rocky Mountains, the word is 'suave qui peut,' and spur and whip are both in requisition.  This Black Harris always created a sensation at the cap fire, being a capital raconteur, and having had as many perilous adventures as any man probably in the mountains.  He was a wiry form, made up of bone and muscle, with a face apparently composed of tan leather and whip cord, finished off with a peculuar blue-black tint, as if gunpowder had been burnt into his face." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In the background of this study are discernible the dome of the church of San Marco and the two granite columns erected in AD 1127, one bearing the Lion of St. Mark and the other, St. Theodore on a crocodile.

This drawing and two accompanying works (WAM 37.2585 and WAM 37.2582) in pencil and gouache were made by the artist in preparation for a painting showing a regatta held on the Grand Canal in May, 1902.

Smith was born on St. Paul Street, Baltimore. He trained initially as an engineer but later taught himself to paint in watercolors. He traveled extensively, producing watercolors which were reproduced in deluxe "travel books," such as "Gondola Days" (1897) and "The Venice of To-Day" (1897) as well as various magazines. He was also the author of many popular books.

    <PublicDescription>In this late painting, Woodville arranged a large group of figures in the light, airy space of an office of a justice of the peace. At the center, a strapping red-haired sailor holds the arm of his demure bride. The dramatic moment is rendered with remarkable economy, from the irritated reaction of the judge interrupted at his supper, to the conciliatory gesture of the bowing groomsman, to the oblivious pride of the sailor and the humble expectation of the elderly members of the wedding party in their "Sunday best." A subsidiary drama unfolds in the doorway, where two African-American figures hold back a crying child and a grizzled old sailor looks in from the street. The details that set the scene, from the books and papers overflowing the horsehair trunk, to an almanac page pasted to the bookcase, to the red spittoon and glistening andirons, all "finished as with a microscope," add to its visual effect. The work evokes genre painting's earlier roots, mocking its lower-class subjects for the amusement of patrons of presumably higher station, while depicting a modern moment.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This portrait bust was modelled after a marble bust of William T. Walters (Walters 28.9). Here, bronze brings out the texture of the skin and makes you wonder what he is thinking.

This object is part of a group of bronzes that was commissioned in 1889 and cast in France. They were made to be slightly smaller than the original marble version. A much larger copy was commissioned in 1907 to be placed over the entrance to the gallery, where it can be seen to this day.

    <PublicDescription>"Towards the Fall the grass, which has attained the height of 3 or 4 feet, becomes parched and dry.  It is then very flammable and either by accident or design takes fire.  The manner of its approach is insidious enough; at first a slight haze immediately detects the nature of the visitor, and all hands in the camp are immediately  busy in setting fire to the long grass about them;- not suffering it to make much headway, but beating it down with cloths &amp; blankets.  In this manner large spaces are cleared, horses, mules, and tents are secured in the burnt areas, which are enlarged as time permits, and escape from certain death is thus averated through a very simple process.  The fire sweeps round with the speed of a race horse, licking up every thing that it touches with its fiery tongue,- leaving nothing in its train but a blackened heath." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller executed this print as the cover for sheet music distributed by the Baltimore music publisher George Willig, Jr. "Far o'er the Deep Blue Sea" was composed by John H. Hewitt with lyrics by R. H. Pratt. Arranged for voice and piano, it was intended to appeal to the large popular market for music to perform in the home. The song opens with a dream of sailing away in the boat of a daring sailor:

The moon is beaming brightly love,
Upon the deep blue sea-
A trusty crew is waiting near
For thee, dear girl, for thee!
Then leave thy downy couch, my love,
And with thy sailor, flee;
His gallant bark shall bear thee safe,
Far o'er the deep blue sea.

    <PublicDescription>Over the crossed flags is superimposed a green enameled wreath which bears a sculpted gold pelican wounding her breast so that her young may feed on her blood. A symbol of Christian charity, the "pelican in her piety" has been associated with the state of Louisiana since 1813. The flags with the seven stars may allude to the flag flown by the Confederate States prior to May 1863.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

He was an inveterate traveler and journeyed to South America (1869), Egypt and Persia (1870), Morocco (frequently between 1872 and 1878), and India (1882-83). This work, set in the 8th-century great mosque of Cordova in Spain, may have been begun in 1880 while Weeks was staying in that city. In Weeks' estate sale catalogue, the scene was described as follows: 

Preaching the holy war against the Christians, the old Moor holds aloft the green flag of Mohammed while he curses the "dogs of Christians" with true religious fervor, and calls upon Mohammed to drive them out of Spain.

Despite the painting's illusion of reality, such a jihad, or holy war, would never have been called for in a mosque.

    <PublicDescription>In 1793, after working in London and Dublin for 18 years, Stuart returned to America. Two years later, he painted his first portrait of George Washington, showing the right side of the president's face, a format since known as the Vaughan type. In the spring of 1796, Washington again sat for Stuart, and the resulting portrait, which was never finished, was originally acquired by the Boston Athenaeum. Depicting the left side of the face, this second version was replicated many times, becoming an icon of American art. 

The Baltimore art collector Robert Gilmor, Jr., for a fee of $150, commissioned the artist to paint this example of the Athenaeum format. It was Stuart's last likeness of Washington.

    <PublicDescription>This meticulously detailed drawing may have been copied from a print. The view is of a boat kiosk on Viginia Water, a lake near Runnymede, England.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"This little industrious harbinger of civilization is fast spreading over the fertile plains of the Far West, and may as well have the credit also of having discovered the 'axiom' that 'a straight line is the shortest distance between two given points,' long before that old fussy fellow Euclid ever dreamed of it.  The mode of finding their hives is illustrated in the sketch.  A piece of honey comb is secured to the top of a bush, this attracts the wild bees, and when several are buzzing about it, the hunters diligently watch them, and as soon as one is ready to start keeps his eye on him.  As he flies direct, the hunter urns with his eyes upward, and never loses sight of him till he reaaches his destination (usually an old hollow tree), axes are now brought into requisition,- the tree felled - split open,- and the hous hold of the poor insects laid bare, filled to overflowing with its sweets, sometimes extending 8 or 10 feet long trunk." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).


In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Mrs. John Barker (the wife of the soldier and prominent Philadelphia politician and mayor General John Barker) is shown wearing a black dress with a wide, white collar and a white cap.

William Russell Birch studied in London. Sir Joshua Reynolds, the leading British portrait painter of his day, commissioned Birch to make small enamel copies of his oil paintings to preserve a record of their colors in case the paintings faded. In 1794 Birch and his family emigrated to Philadelphia, then the capital and largest and wealthiest city in America. Birch brought with him a letter of recommendation from Benjamin West, and he soon set up shop painting enamel miniatures. Enamel was the favored medium for minuitures in England from ca. 1630 into the 18th century. Birch was the most acclaimed American miniaturists working in enamel.

Archival photographs show this portrait and its companion piece in conventional nineteenth-century frames, now lost, suggesting they were once displayed hanging on a wall.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Almost waist-length portrait of Robert A. Taylor, with head three-quarters to the left, with light curly brown hair parted at left side, and a small chin beard. He wears a black coat with white shirt and white collar.

Robert A. Taylor was the son of William Wallace Taylor Jr. and Catharine Augusta Birckhead (see WAM 38.480 and WAM 38.481 by the same artist). His father was the Director of the Union Bank of Maryland and was also linked with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and many other local businesses. The family lived in 7 West Mount Vernon Place, making them the neighbours of the Walters family who lived at 5 West. (For more information see "History of Baltimore Maryland, from its founding as a town to the current year, 1792-1898").

Robert was involved in numerous local businesses, and was also a Justice of the Peace. In 1858 he married Mary Maught, from a landowning and milling family from Frederick County, MD. (For more information see "History of Baltimore Maryland, from its founding as a town to the current year, 1792-1898").

Born in Leeds, England, and trained in an architect's office, Richard Morrell Staigg came to the United States in 1831. Washington Allston encouraged him and he soon devoted himself to miniature painting. He was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy of Design, New York City, of which he was elected an associate in 1856, and an academician in 1861. In the last two decades of his life he devoted himself to portraits, landscapes and genre scenes in oil.

    <PublicDescription>"The red men seem to be exempt from one curse that is quite general in civilized life.  We allude to ennui.  Low spirits and despair are not their attributes.  Our Indian in the sketch, finding that all the larger animals have been driven off, is glad to return home with smaller game.  In default of this, he would have contentedly gone to sleep without anything;- indeed without much seeming inconvenience, he could continue his fast for a day or two.  He has been tortured in his youth by the most painful contrivances to give him courage and endurance." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In 1894, J. de Morgan excavated several magnificent ancient pectorals from the tomb of Princess Mereret, daughter of Sesostris III, in Dahshur, Egypt. Soon after this discovery, this faithful replica was made. Unlike many Egyptianizing pieces, this example copies the details of the original without major errors or changes; only the size and material are slightly varied: silver and multicolored enamels replaced gold, carnelian, and faience. The brooch, in the form of a kiosk, gives the names of the pharaohs Sesostris III and Amenemhet III from the middle of the 12th Dynasty (19th century BC). Below the wings of a protective vulture, the pharaohs are depicted as sphinxes slaying their enemies.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Miller was impressed with Shim-a-co-che (High Lance), the Crow chief, a distinguished man, "full of dignity, and such as you might look for in a well-bred civilized gentleman."  Miller noted his "grave look," the "well-cut Roman nose," and the "forehead [that] retreats overmuch...," and recalled that Shim-a-co-che had protested that some of the other sitters for Miller's portraits were common Indians who had counted no coups and did not deserve to be painted.  - Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>" While Indians are resting in camp, one of their amusements (if their evil star is not in the ascendant) is a trial of skill with the Elk-horn bow.  Of course, a wager is laid in order to give zest to the trial and earnestness to the matter on hand.  The stakes are of a multitudinous character,- Pleagh of beaver, against Couteau de chasse,- heads agains clother,- powder against tobacco,- &amp;c.  In the absense of any other stake, he will bet his own daughter.  They are careful to select a calm day, and at a distance of 30 or 40 yards strike within the sircumference of a wuarter of a dollar.  The arrow is tipped with iron, and feathering remarkablye for its neatness, giving a poise true and equal, this is essential to a good aim." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller.

    <PublicDescription>"The scene represented is the broad prairie; the whole plain is dotted with lodges and tents, with groups of Indians surrounding them;- In the river near the foreground Indians are bathing; to the left rises a bluff overlooking the plain whereon are stationed some Braves and Indian women. In the midst of them is Capt. Bridger in a full suit of steel armour.  This gentleman was a famous mountain man, and we venture to say that no one has travelled here within the last 30 years without seeing or hearing of him.  The suit of armor was imported from England and presented to Capt. B. by our commander;- it was a fac-simile of that worn by the English life-guards, and created a sensation when worn by him on stated occasions." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The Indian exercise great ingenuity, with an eye for modelling and symmetry in the construction of their canoes.  From the want of proper tools they are compelled to hollow out the log by slow fires placed at intervals, removing the charred parts and again applying the fire;- this process is continued until sufficient depth is obtained, when with tomahawks and knives they trim and shape the interior with great patience and labor,- the log is then reversed, and after finisheing the bottom, the ends are crved precisely alike, in order that the boat may move either way when in the water. The birch-bark canoe (the subject of our sketch) is still more elegant in shape and more buoyant on the water,- but not so strong a the former. In propelling the boat the Indians use flat paddles, two or more on each side,- the sketch will convey an idea of the boat's appearance on the river." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This miniature is after the "Vaughan portrait" of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart. Birch, an English-born miniaturist, enamel painter and engraver, studied at Bristol and London. In London between 1781 and 1784 he exhibited at the Royal Academy, and copied portraits by Joshua Reynolds in miniature. He invented a new color for the use of enamelists. In 1784 he was awarded a silver palette by the Society of Art for the Painting in Enamel. Though he seems to have been successful in England, in 1794 he came to America with a letter of recommendation from Benjamin West, who was then in London, and settled in Philadelphia with his four children. He soon found a number of commissions for enamels and is particularly famed for his portraits of Washington. He worked after the so-called "Athenaeum" and "Vaughan" portraits of the president, making approximately sixty copies, of which this may be one. He was also an engraver, and is known in America for his views of Philadelphia and American country seats, produced with his son Thomas. He apparently had Baltimore connections, and made several trips to the city on buisness. The miniature is in a turned wood frame.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Aurora, seen here both frontally and in profile, was the Roman goddess of dawn who, as night ended, would rise to the heavens in her chariot to announce the coming of the sun.  As she rode, her hair was swept in the wind.  That this image is copyrighted suggests that the artist intended to reproduce it as a print to be sold. A companion piece for this miniature called "The Golden Hour" has not been located (see "Scribner's Magazine," XXI, 1897, p. 251). Baer is known to have painted some eleven allegorical subjects of this kind.

William Jacob Baer was born in Cincinnati in 1860, where he was trained in lithography. In 1880 he traveled to Munich to study drawing and painting at the Royal Academy. When he returned to the United States, he lived in New Jersey where he taught drawing and painting at Princeton University. In 1893 he moved to New York and where he first painted portrait miniatures; by 1894 he had given up easel painting all together to focus exclusively on this genre. He helped found the American Society of Miniature Painters, and is considered instrumental in the revival of miniature at the end of the 19th century. Baer exhibited both nationally and internationally, at the Exposition Universelle (1900), Pan-American Exposition (1901), Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904), and the Panama-Pacific Exposition (1915), where he work was well received. He seems to have found particular success with Henry Walters and his relatives. The Walters Art Museum holds six works on ivory by the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length portrait of William Wallace Taylor, Jr., facing three-quarters to the right, with brown hair and beard, wearing a black coat, white shirt and black stock.

The subject is the Baltimore dry goods merchant, businessman and banker, who came from a prominent local mercantile family. He graduated from Mount Hope College in 1839. In 1850 he became a director of the Merchant's Bank of Baltimore, as his father had been before him, and in 1861 he became Director of the Union Bank of Maryland. He was also linked with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and many other local businesses. In 1847 he married Catharine Augusta Birckhead (see companion piece WAM 38.481), whose family also were strongly connected to the Union Bank of Maryland, her grandfather, Solomon, being one of its incorporators. The family lived in 7 West Mount Vernon Place, making them the neighbours of the Walters family who lived at 5 West. (For more information see "History of Baltimore Maryland, from its founding as a town to the current year, 1792-1898").

Born in Leeds, England, and trained in an architect's office, Richard Morrell Staigg came to the United States in 1831. Washington Allston encouraged him and he soon devoted himself to miniature painting. He was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy of Design, New York City, of which he was elected an associate in 1856, and an academician in 1861. In the last two decades of his life he devoted himself to portraits, landscapes and genre scenes in oil.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, scenes of life in Baltimore, and comical situations and characters. This drawing shows a house on the Jones Falls, a stream running through Baltimore.

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"Hunters, after wounding the Buffalo and seeing him fall, sometimes alight from their horses and approach.  In this case they have reckoned without their host:- the animal has again regained his feet and gives battle.  One of them to escape his fury has thrown down his blanket, in order to have time to regain his saddle;- on this unlucky blanket, the Buffalo is expending his fury, under the pleasing delu-[sion] that he is pitching into somebody, and while so engaged, another shot is prepared for him which gives him his quietus."   A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In one of our hunting excursions, we encountered a small party of Indians, our interpreter was not present, and it was desirable to have some information that we stood in need of.  The sketch represents the Indian communicating this by signs, which he does by graceful action and significant gesture, so that in the main, it is readily comprehended by persons, of course having some practice and experience.  Some of the signs are easily interpreted,- for instance,- joining the palms of the hands and throwing them upward and outward, to signify day time,- action reversed, palms downward, night.  Time is indicated by pointing directly over-head for meridian, and at any point from East to West, where the sun would probably be at the time,- for that hour.  Sleeping is indicated by inclining the head in the palm of the hand, and closing the eyes for a moment &amp;c. One of the cheif difficulties in acquiring the Indian language is the gutteral pronounciation;- without the even, it is not an easy matter." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

(See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>The Düsseldorf-trained artist visited Naples and Capri in the summer of 1857. This drawing bears an inscription on the reverse: "Mr. Walters with the compliments of the author." It was formerly housed in one of William T. Walters' many drawings albums.

The Blue Grotto on the north side of the island of Capri had become renowned as an attraction for tourists during the 19th century. Because its entrance was about three feet high it could be entered in a small rowboat. The interior of the grotto is about 39 feet high and its depth is 50 feet.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>Blauvelt studied with Charles Loring Elliott and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. He specialized in small genre paintings, frequently of single figures. He pursued a career in genre and portraits in New York (1847-1862), Philadelphia (1862-67), and New York again before settling in Annapolis where he taught draftsmanship at the Naval Academy. Blauvelt was among the artists whom William T. Walters encountered during his forays in the New York art market just prior to the Civil War, acquiring 5 works by the artist. This work in oil on paper was original housed in one of William T. Walters' many drawings albums.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The time represented in the sketch is early morning, and the Caravan has placed itself en route,- our old friends the Delawares as usual are delaying and inactive.  These Delawares when William Penn landed in America were a strong and powerful nation, and received that distinguished man and his followers with open arms and a hearty welcome.  They sat in Council and listened to his friendly tongue and soft speeches, when (if they had studied their own interst) they might have pitched then whole straight-coated fraternity into the River." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Proud of being one of the few artists to see the Rocky Mountains before the Oregon Trail was fully initiated, Miller read the accounts of explorers like John C. Frémont and revised the captions for his pictures in the light of their findings.  When he encountered George Catlin in London, he commented to his brother that there was a great deal of "humbug" about Catlin and that Catlin was lucky there were so few people who had seen the West and who could discredit him.  Miller, of course, considered himself one of the few.

Marshall Sprague, author of an essay about Miller and Stewart, has suggested that this is Frémont Lake.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"The hunters are here taking an advantage of a peculiar trait, of failing of these animals.  A large number are in sight, and although they have taken the alarm, and the greater part are in full retreat,- yet a few remain gazing in stupid curiosity at the approaching hunters.  The latter seeing this push on with all speed in the hope of getting a shot at them before they can recover from this apparent trance.  It is perfectly useless to run them whtn they once start, as their speed far outstrips the fleetest horses.  When about half a dozen men are in the field, by a process called 'ringing Antelopes,' they capture a goodly number.  The first object after discovering the band is to get a party on every side of them;- when the herd puts itself in motion, the hunter in the direction to which it tends, gallops forward and the timid animals dart off at another angle to be frightened by the same apparition in that quarter,- it is coninued until theyr are exhausted, when the hunters close in and shoot: - this seems to recall their scattered senses, when all not wounded, take courage, make a charge through the circle, and are gone in a moment."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"About half an hour before the halt for evening, scouts are sent out in advance of the main body, in order to reconnoitre and select a spot combining the requisites for an encampment:- as the wagons and charettes approach the location, they take a circuitous course, and by the time the last vehicle has reached the ground, the Caravan has formed a circumference of 5 or 600 feet;- the horses and mules are now unharnessed, and loosed to feed, leaving the vehicles at a dinstance of some 30 feet apart, forming a species of barricade; towards sundown the horses are driven in and picketed, and this scene forms the subject of our sketch.  Most extensive cookery ensues, and the prairie forms the only table available for the viands." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

The miniature is housed in an elaborate leather case, tooled with gold and lined with velvet.

    <PublicDescription>"August, a half-breed Canadian, who is here represented watering his horse, was one amongst the best of all our mountain men, with a lithe and active form, exuberant spirits, quick percption - especially of the ridiculous, - and brave to recklessness; he was the life of the Camp, from his excessive drollery and bon homie." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This vase with dragonfly handles and raised clematis vine motifs is rendered in silver with a "martelé" (hammered) surface and is decorated with colored metal encrustations. This combination of techniques recalls the work of Japanese craftsmen who once specialized in the production of swords and sword accessories. After visiting the Japanese display at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1867, Edward Chandler Moore (1827-91), Tiffany's master silversmith, became a leading proponent of "Japonisme."

    <PublicDescription>"In the progress of our journey we took especial care to see as much as possible of the Indian in his domestic life.  In making such visits our men carried their rifles, as an Indian's respect for you is increased thereby, and indeed your safety depends often upon it.  Whenever we found friendly Indians encamped, the inevitable pipe was brought forward and passed around, each taking two or three whiffs,- this not only proclaims good will towards you.  As they are perfectly free from care and responsibilities of all kinds, it is not wonderful that Trappers and travellers soon begin to have sympathy and fondness for their mode of life." A.J.

    <PublicDescription>"A camp of Indians leaving an enemy in the rear,- journeying towards the river,- ford it,- continue  their course along its banks for a time, and then recross.  This stratagem is effected to baffle their pursuers,- throw them out,- and afford no clue to their whereabouts.  A whole village moves off in this manner with short notice,- tents and lodges being packed on mules, while the poles are secured by the ends and trail on the ground.

    <PublicDescription>Jennie (1853-1922) was the daughter of William T. Walters and the sister of Henry Walters, the founder of this museum. In 1876, against the strong objections of her father (who had intended her to remain his companion in his advancing years), she married Warren Delano III at the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Redeemer in Baltimore. The Delanos resided in Orange, New Jersey, and later in New York City. Jennie, who has been recalled as short in stature and full in figure, was an early feminist.

William Jacob Baer was born in Cincinnati in 1860, where he was trained in lithography. In 1880 he traveled to Munich to study drawing and painting at the Royal Academy. When he returned to the United States, he lived in New Jersey where he taught drawing and painting at Princeton University. In 1893 he moved to New York and where he first painted portrait miniatures; by 1894 he had given up easel painting all together to focus exclusively on this genre. He helped found the American Society of Miniature Painters, and is considered instrumental in the revival of miniature at the end of the 19th century. Baer exhibited both nationally and internationally, at the Exposition Universelle (1900), Pan-American Exposition (1901), Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904), and the Panama-Pacific Exposition (1915), where he work was well received. He seems to have found particular success with Henry Walters and his relatives. The Walters Art Museum holds six works on ivory by the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"A large body of Indians, Traders, and Trappers are here congregated, and the view seen from the bluff is pleasing and animated.  In the middle distance a race is being run, the horses in all cases running in a direct line and never in a circle as with us.  The bets pending on the result are extraordinary in character and diversity, and the Indians are passionately fond of this species of gambling.  If an Indian happes to lose all,- he will stake the dress he wears against 3 or 4 ounces of vermillion, and if you win can demand it at once, leaving him almost in the condition of Adam before the fall.  The Company's tent is besieged on such occasions.  No matter who lose, they are sure to win.  Ball playing with bandys and other games are largely indulged in, and the Company make it a point to encourage the Indians in these sports to divert their minds form mischief.  White Lodges ranging form 12 to 16 ft. in height are scattered at random over the plain and reach almost to the foot of the distant mountains." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

"Unsophisticated youth [loq r]- Frank while I have been tickled to death with the farce, I notice that these fiddlers never move a muscle, but look as if they are to be hung immediately if not sooner."

Miller, especially in his younger days, was a devotee of the stage. In Baltimore he had the opportunity to enjoy the widely varied fare presented at the city's two principal theaters, the Holliday, one of the nations's most venerable houses dating from 1792, and the Front, built in 1829.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The foreground of the sketch presents some Indian women in repose;- they have dismounted from their horses near a stream, where the Caravan will halt for a 'nooning.'  Much cannot be said in favor of the manner in which the female part of the community are treated by the Indians,- they are mere 'hewers of wood and drawers fo water.' - the North American savage entertaining, we fear, a kindred opinion with the Turks, id est - that they have no souls.  When the grande Seigneur arrives,- they set up his lodge, spread his robes, unladen the horses &amp; mules, make his fire, and prepare his meat.  On might suppose that this would entitle them to some little acknowledgment,- but if they receive a grunt of acquiescence it is more than is always accorded.  This trait does not solely belong to our Indians,- it may be observed in all barbarous countries, and civilzation here presents a glorious and shining contrast.  Indeed the rise and progress of the latter may be graduated by the estimation in which women are held, and her appreciation as a companion and faithful friend of man, even when all others discard him." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"The Indians have just driven the bear from his covert among some wild cherry bushes, which fruit is decidedly one of his weaknesses; of it he is remarkably fond.  They are preparing to run him, giving him at the same time a wide berth, knowing very well the formidable qualities of the brute they have to deal with.  As an arrow sometiems fails to pierce his body, owing to thick matted hair, they aim usually at the head, the most vulnerable part." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length portrait of an elderly gentleman facing front, with white hair worn in bangs with side whiskers. He wears a black coat, black vest, white shirt, and high white neckband tied in a bow.

Marchant was a self-taught artist who began his career as a house painter. He worked mainly in oils, but a few miniatures by him are known. He established a portrait studio in Edgartown Massachusetts in the mid 1820s, but by late 1826 he traveled to Charleston and advertised his services there. After spending 1828-29 in Edgartown, the artist moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, where he maintained a "painting room" and painted some of city's most prominent personalities. After 1832 he worked in New York City, but continued to travel for work as for as Nashville, New Orleans and cities in Ohio. He exhibited regularly.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Gifford was an important Hudson River school luminist. He began his career as a portrait painter but in 1843 became attracted to landscapes. This direction was solidified by a sketching tour of the Catskills and Berkshires. Gifford greatly admired the work of Thomas Cole but rejected his heroic allegorical themes focusing instead on subtle yet dramatic light effects. In the 1850s he traveled and studied throughout Europe, painting with Albert Bierstadt in Italy, and meeting the great art critic John Ruskin. He made another extended trip through Europe from 1868-70. 

This painting depicts the Arch of Nero. In 1846 the same subject had been painted viewed from the opposite side by Cole (this painting is now in the Newark Museum, New Jersey, accession number 57.24). The Brooklyn Museum holds a sketchbook by Gifford dating from 1867-1868 (accession number 17.141) and pages 70 and 71 show studies of figures and the arch. On the right hand page is a sketch within a ruled "frame" that almost exactly anticipates the Walters painting.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Tiffany was the foremost American exponent of the Art Nouveau movement, which rejected historical styles and called for a re-examination of vegetal and zoological motifs, particularly as seen in Japanese art. He developed it into a sensuous, organic style. The Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, founded in Corona, New York, in 1892, was particularly known for its "Favrile" glass, which imitated the iridescent sheen that ancient Roman glass acquired after being buried for centuries.

    <PublicDescription>Justice is depicted here as a slightly draped man, seated, wearing a helmet. This piece is said to be a reduction of a work commissioned for the Essex County Court House, Newark, New Jersey.

The artist wrote in a letter to the Walters Art Museum in 1940: "I think I made them ["Inspiration" (WAM 54.692) and "Justice"] in 1903, that they belong to Mr. Hebrard, Rue Royale, Paris, and were by him sold to Mr. Walters in 1906. They are the original studies for other works and there are no other copies in existence."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In addition to the scenes of frontier life for which the artist is best known, Miller sketched many depictions of actors and theatrical subjects. This sketch is captioned with two lines from Shakespeare's "Love's Labour's Lost:"

Wellcome the Sour Cup of prosperity.-
Affliction may one day smile again.

This identifies the scene as the final moments of Act I, Scene 1, in which constable Dull and the cynical courtier Berowne march the clownish Costard off stage.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Largely self-taught, Blakelock exhibited in the National Academy of Design. However, in 1891 he suffered his first nervous breakdown and from 1899 was committed to a psychiatric hospital. However, around this time his works began to find favor with collectors and in 1916, with his paintings fetching large sums, Blakelock was made an Academician.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Red Elk, as In-ca-tash-a-pa's name was translated, was a distinguished Snake warrior.  Miller has painted him with an ornamented bandeau set off by a rosette with feathers.  Wampum beads encircle his neck, along with a kind of flat shell.

While not as detailed in terms of costume and decoration as Catlin's and Bodmer's Indian portraits, Miller's are more romantic in their conception and presentation.  Both Bodmer and Catlin strove for accuracy in detail, while Miller was interested in showing the Indians as the noble savages in the wilderness.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This portrait by Miller depicts Sarah Malvina Allen (September 15, 1824-December 16, 1854) who married William Herald Heald, a prominent Baltimore businessman, in 1844. It is a companion piece to Miller's portrait of her husband (WAM 37.2509).  Probably as a result of the business ties between his brothers Decatur and Columbus and the Healds, Miller executed a number of portraits of members of the Heald family.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The English-born Thomas Cole came to the United States at the age of 18 and eventually settled in New York, working as a portrait and landscape painter. There, he was a founder of the National Academy of Design. With the financial support of his patron Robert Gilmor of Baltimore he travelled abroad in 1829, and visited Florence and Rome in 1832. He returned to Italy, stopping in Rome and in Naples in 1841-1842. Cole's vision was profoundly influenced by the classical landscapes of the 17th-century masters Claude Lorraine and Nicolas Poussin.

This work was formerly housed in one of William T. Walters' many drawings albums.

    <PublicDescription>This charming but puzzling drawing is perhaps inspired by the work of John Flaxman. However, the subject matter is a humorous take on the Classics. Venus sits at a tripod-like table, fanning herself with one of cupid's wings (the other wing can be seen on the floor). She looks side-long at her reflection in a small round mirror propped on the table between a small rose-tree planted in an urn and a goldfish bowl. More curiously still, the goldfish bowl contains a heart, which a cat paws at, leaning over the rim. Cupid has discarded a top and now plays with his bow, riding it as if it were a hobby-horse. A kneeling youth looks up, perhaps at the tree and butterflies or perhaps at Venus, while breaking an arrow across his knee. Other arrows are scattered on the floor and Venus rests one foot on an empty quiver. There may be a specific "solution" to this visual puzzle, or it might be an open-ended provocation to viewers to devise the most plausible or erudite explanation for the bizarre composition.

The artist was a Baltimore native, and in 1848 served as the assistant librarian for the Gallery of Fine Arts at the Maryland Historical Society, which was founded in 1844. Beginning in 1848 the Historical Society presented annual exhibitions of Old Master paintings and contemporary works drawn from local collections. Mayer went on to form the Allston Association with a group of friends for the appreciation of American Artists. He also served on the club's Board of Directors. William T. Walters was a member, and early meetings were held at Mayer's house. In June 1863 the Allston Association was closed by the federal leader General Schenck as it was suspected of being a stronghold for secessionists. Perhaps because if the Civil War he relocated to Paris from 1864-69 and enrolled in the studio of Charles Gleyre, the academic master who included among his pupils the impressionists Monet, Sisley, Bazille, and Renoir. After this Mayer returned to Baltimore.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"We found this Indian at our encampment near Wind River,- he differed from all others in one particular; he was a bon vivant, a free, rollicking, laughter-loving Indian; - a kind of "Mark Tapley" -always jolly and extremely good natured.  These traits recommended him to our Trappers, who were always desirous of having this rare avis at our Camp fire, feasting him to his heart's content.  He made himself welcome by the most pleasing of all qualities, continual gaiety and bon hommée - his twinkling eyes showing how much he enjoyed the bagatelle of the Canadians.  From his being somewhat more muscular and stoutly built than the generality of Indians, they gave him the name of Bras de fer.  His fondness for fun, however, militated against him as regards position among his brother Indians, and not only precluded him from their councils, but also prevented his election as Chief."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"To a people who delight in war, and who are instructed from youth in its principles, and practice, it is almost useless to preach the blessings of peace.  If you atempt to explain the benefits that may accrue to them from the observance of the later, they ahve a ready answer: 'If we make jeace how shall we employ our young men?' They point out to you their scalps and arms, and as- 'Shall we throw these away, and become women?' If a relative or member of their tribe is killed, they will listen to neither palliation or justification, but pursue relentlessly any member of their offender's company, to have their revenge. This perhaps forms one of their worst traits, and cannot be defended, yet it is characteristic of the whole of them.  In the sketch, and Indian has secured the scalp-lock of his enemy, and is making good his escape,- for this honor awaits him in his camp, and it often presents a strong claim for the post of a chief or brave." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).  This sketch comes from a Vernon Miller Family Album.

    <PublicDescription>Sentimental miniature scenes in the neoclassical style, often painted in sepia and framed by a single border of diamonds, are characteristic motifs of late 18th-and early 19th-century rings. Here, a mourning woman is shown leaning in a thoughtful pose on a large anchor, a symbol of hope. The early Christians adopted the pagan symbol of the anchor, signifying safety, and transformed it into a symbol for hope in salvation. This mourning ring was likely won to express the hope that the deceased had been admitted to heaven.</PublicDescription>

Louis Gaylord Clark (1808-1873) succeeded Charles Fenno Hoffman as editor and publisher of the "The Knickerbocker" magazine, a role he held for over 25 years (1834–1861). By 1840, it had become the most influential literary publication of the time in the United States, especially through the contributions from such writers as Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and by Clark's own departments, the "Editors Table" and "Gossip with Readers and Correspondents." During his career, Clark made an enemy of fellow editor and author Edgar Allan Poe. The two traded insults in their respective magazines.

Charles Loring Elliott was the leading American portraitist of the mid-19th century. Mainly working in New York City he portrayed many artists and writers.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The oval miniature is mounted in an imported Italian gold brooch decorated with alternating bands of beaded, braided and woven patterns. Engraved on the reverse are the letters "E. A. H." in script. 

Born in Leeds, England, and trained in an architect's office, Richard Morrell Staigg came to the United States in 1831. Washington Allston encouraged him and he soon devoted himself to miniature painting. He was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy of Design, New York City, of which he was elected an associate in 1856, and an academician in 1861. In the last two decades of his life he devoted himself to portraits, landscapes and genre scenes in oil.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The scene is a normal day in an Indian village, with the teepee thrown open to admit the fresh air while the Indians in front are making bows, arrows, and so on. In the foreground, a warrior is petting his horse. Miller, perhaps in anticipation of the old cowboy-and-horse story, suggested that, if the Indian had to choose between his horse and his bride, "we opine that the horse would be the first choice." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"We reached this point about sunset on our way to the Lakes, and from fatigue rested here for the night; it gave me ample time to obtain a sketch from the bluff rock to the left, which completely overlooked one of the Lakes, the object of our pilgrimage.  Solitude brooded over the scene, and with the exception of our party, the eye wandered in vain to discover a living being, or a sign of habitation... The rays of the declining sun glimmered on the distant tops of the snow-covered peaks, while darkness had already begun to cast its pall on the valley below,- the air becoming sensibly colder as the night advanced.  In the gorge or pass at the foot of the rock, our men were engaged in building a huge bonfire, singing, chansons d'amour, and waiting for François and his mule to bring along the mountain sheep our hunters had secured;- for it must be confessed, that hunger too the pas of natural scenery with all its charms,- sometimes!" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"In looking at a body of these fellows scouring the prairies, one cannot fail to be impressed with their admirable horsemanship, and that such subjects originally gave birth to the conception of the fabled Centaur.  A piece of Buffalo robe (á pish à maux) serves for a seat, and their bridle is composed of a piece of rope made of plaited bull-hide, attached to the lower lip of the horse; - this is all they required.  Their great hold on the horse is with their knees, and it is almost impossible for an animal to throw them.  We have seen them while their horses have been in full motion stoop and break a switch close to the ground, recovering their seat in a moment.  One of their greatest delights is to mount a wild or unbroken horse.  They master him in a short time, let him be as intractable and vicious as he may."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"We found the way exceeding rough in journeying to these Lakes, and as if that was not enough were digged a great part of the distance by about 20 Crow Indians, who had some cause of grievance with one of our party.  As we rode, the Trappers levelled at them fierce expletives in French, interspersed with sac-r-r-r-es, with a fearful roll on the r-r-'s, Enfans des garcés, &amp;c., they of course not understanding a word.  At lenght we rid ourselves of them by riding at night and crossing some mountain Torrents, thereby losing the trail for them.  

'No primrose road of dalliance' met our eyes, we scrabled over rocks, through briars and brushwood, crossed rapid streams and ascended steep acclivities.  We at least found ourselves on the borders of these beautiful Lakes, and were richly repaid for all our difficulties... The sketch, although conveying some idea, must of necessity fall short of the enchanting reality."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Soon after passing Chimney Rock, the traveler saw Scott's Bluffs, a mound with the appearance of an "immense fortification with bastions, towers, battlements, and embrazures" to Miller. Stewart (Edward Warren, p. 156) called it "an obstacle to be surmounted." The name originated, Miller noted, when a man named Scott became sick and had to be abandoned near the bluffs, but there are many other versions of the story.

"The name originates from a lamentable event that happened here many years ago.  A band of men were proceeding to the mountains:- on reaching this bluff one of the party (Scott) sickened and became so ill that after waiting a few days, they were compelled to go on;- they however detailed a man to remain with the sick man, and bring him on when recovered.  Certain appearances about these bluffs would seem to indicate that all the prairie hereabouts was at once time covered with water." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"These Indians," wrote Miller, "are anti-belligerent, and have some other qualities that are rare and commendable; they are said to be religious, and honest and truthful in their intercourse with the whites. Their observance of religious ceremonies and rites are uniform and remarkable."

Many Indians from the middle Columbia River area pierced their nose and wore rings or thin dentalium shells in their septums. That is the trait for which the Nez Perces are historically named, and this Miller portrait is one of the earlier documents that shows a ring "thrust through" the brave's nose.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller executed this print as the cover for sheet music distributed by the Baltimore music publisher George Willig, Jr. "Far o'er the Deep Blue Sea" was composed by John H. Hewitt with lyrics by R. H. Pratt. Arranged for voice and piano, it was intended to appeal to the large popular market for music to perform in the home. The song opens with a dream of sailing away in the boat of a daring sailor:

The moon is beaming brightly love,
Upon the deep blue sea-
A trusty crew is waiting near
For thee, dear girl, for thee!
Then leave thy downy couch, my love,
And with thy sailor, flee;
His gallant bark shall bear thee safe,
Far o'er the deep blue sea.

    <PublicDescription>"On reaching the Buffalo District, one of our young men began to be ambitious, and although it was his first journey, boasted continually of what he would do in hunting Buffalo if permitted.  This was John (our cook), he was an Englishman and did no discredit to that illustrious nation in his stupid conceit and wrong-headed obstinacy.  Our Captain, when any one boasted, put them to the test, so a day was given to John and he started off early alone.  The day passed over, night came, - but so did not John.  Another day rolled over, the hunters returning at evening without having met him.  The next morning men were dispatched in different quarters, and at about two o'clock, one of the parties brought in the wanderer - crest fallen and nearly starved;- he was met by a strom of ridicule and roasted on every side by the Trappers.  Thus carrying out that ugly maxim of Rochefoucault's "There is always something in the misfortune of our friends not disagreeable to us."' A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"It will be perceived that etiquette among this wild people is ovserved with great punctilio.  This poor woman would no more think fo riding alongside of the great man in fromt that of cutter off her right hand;- She looks on him as her hero, and as a condensation of all virtues." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"From the bluffs, as from an observatory, the vigilant Indian overlooks the prairie far and near. His cunning eye sweeps the horizon in all directions &amp; from long practice he discerns an object (like the sailor on the ocean) much sooner than an ordinary observer. He marks in what direction game is to be had, the approach of an enemy or emigrant train (all being fish that come to his net). He balances the chances if the latter, and uses his discretion whether to send out his warriors or not, for he will not give battle without the odds are greatly in his favor. In collision he asks no quarter, nor expects any, but has an intense admiration that 'to the victor belongs the spoils' and carries it out to the last letter." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"One of the strongest objections the Indians have made (in their removal to ther homes in the Far West) has been that of leaving the graves of their relatives and friends.  It is notorious that they traverse immense districts of wilderness for the sole purpose of paying a visit to the last resting place of their dead.  The modes of burial are various, each tribe differing from another.  Sometimes on the death of a chief, his favorite horse is sacrificed and buried under the mound with him. Now and then the traveller encounters a solitary Lodge or two, on entering them he finds an Indian deceased, and laid out in his war dress with such arms as he would be supposed to want placed near at hand.  The ordinary burial is a mound with a Buffalo skull (fit emblem of mortality) placed upon it.  The Indians make their stated pilgrimages to these spots, sit down quietly, and seem to commune with the inmate.  With them it is a grand mystery, and not otherwise with us;- Be assured that they cannot fathom it;- not a whit more can we.  'All that we know is,- nothing can be known.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Mayer, a Baltimore painter, trained with the local artists Ernst Fischer and Alfred Jacob Miller before moving to Paris in 1864-69 to enroll in the studio of Charles Gleyre, the academic master who included among his pupils the impressionists Monet, Sisley, Bazille, and Renoir. Otherwise, he spent most of his career in Baltimore, where he became noted for his paintings of scenes set in Colonial times. In this painting, he has depicted the wedding of a young woman named Angelique, whom he met while abroad.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This watercolor was presented to George A. Lucas (1824-1909), the art-agent and collector, who subsequently gifted it to Henry Walters in 1908, the year before his death. The model is Maud Franklin, who Whistler met in London, perhaps as early as 1872 when she was just 15 years old. Franklin posed in a kimono as body-double for Mrs. Frances Leyland, who Whistler was painting at this time. Franklin seems to have become romantically involved with the artist during these sittings. After they relocated to France in 1879 Franklin suffered ill health and Whistler depicted her in bed several times (see James McNeill Whistler "Drawings, Pastels, and Watercolours: A Catalogue Raisonné," by Margaret F. MacDonald, pp. 342-344). She was the mother of two chidren with Whistler, but the affair ended in 1888 when he married Beatrix Godwin.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"As an Indian's riches is generally rated by the number of horses he possesses, and these (by various casualties) sometimes lessen in number, either through his war parties, stolen by othe tribes, or natural deaths, it behooves him at stated intervals to call around him his 'good men and true,' with lariats and tackle in good order, and set out on a foray to catch these valuable animals.  In doing this he does not confine himself to the strict  letter of the wild-horse question; for should he meet with any of his old enemies the Crows, or Camanches, he does not hesitate to turn and do battle with them, conquer them if possible, take their horses, and strip them of everything.  Why should he trouble himself to look after wild horses, when tame ones may be had at the trifling cost of a little pounding? No! no!- all are fish that comes to his net; - and this creed or its equivalent he firmly believes in." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch represents the interior of a Lodge and the Snake Indian entertaining a free Trapper at a feast.  The latter is engaged in recounting some adventure to his host, partly by his limited knowledge of the Indian Language, and by signs.  To the right is seated an Indian woman who watches his every movement with intense interest;- she has no doubt often heard of the extravagant generosity of these reckless follows, and worships him accordingly."

    <PublicDescription>The Indian custom, of course, called for the young man to pay the family of the girl he chose for his wife.  But in this case, Miller says, the brave has only his horse and he does not want to give it up.  So he slipped into the village when the other men were away hunting and persuaded the maiden to go with him.  The old men mounted their horses and pursued the couple to the river but could not catch them.   Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>This self-portrait provides a lively, flattering image of a man who was not known for his good looks.

During the first third of the 19th century, Jarvis was America's most fashionable portrait painter. He was based in New York but frequently traveled south to serve his wealthy clientele. This self-portrait was first shown at Peale's Baltimore Museum in 1822. Subsequently, it was owned by Baltimorean Robert Gilmor, Jr. (1774-1848), one of America's first major art collectors.

    <PublicDescription>Head and shoulders portrait of a young man with dark brown hair, wearing a black coat with white stock tie. The arrangement of hair on the back of this miniature is sadly damaged, but is an elaborate example of its type. The use of gold wire in the form of ears of wheat and half pearls is typical. Miniature painters were often also skilled in working hair.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This drawing in ink shows a nude man in Michelangelesque style lying on a jutting ledge of rock, illustrating six lines from the English poet William Collins (1721-1759), written below the drawing, as follows: "Danger, whose form of giant mould / What mortal eye dare, fix'd, behold! / Who stalks his round and hideous Form / Howling admidst the midnight storm; / Or throws him on the ridgy steep / Of some loose hanging rock to Sleep." This work was formerly housed in one of William T. Walters' drawings albums.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Smith was born on St. Paul Street, Baltimore. He trained initially as an engineer but later taught himself to paint in watercolors. He traveled extensively, producing watercolors which were reproduced in deluxe "travel books," such as "Gondola Days" (1897) and "The Venice of To-Day" (1897) as well as various magazines. He was also the author of many popular books.

The artist regarded this view of the Grand Canal showing the 17th-century church, Santa Maria della Salute, as one of his masterpieces.

    <PublicDescription>Woodville adopted the subject of newspaper reading seen in works by his Düsseldorf contemporaries Johann Peter Hasenclever and Wilhelm Kleinenbroich, placing it in a distinctly American interior, described by a contemporary critic as "one of those subterranean temples devoted to the immolation of bivalves . . . vulgarly known as oyster cellars."  After their meal, the younger of the two figures, bearded and wearing his top hat indoors, leans across the table, counting arguments off on the fingers of one hand and clasping the newspaper that fuels his opinions in the other. The older man, balding, ruddy-faced, and red-nosed, warmed by the liquor in his half-empty glass, looks out with amusement at the viewer. The booth in which they are seated, with its red privacy curtain pulled aside, creates a shallow proscenium stage for this scene of intergenerational argument. The characters are engaged with the politics of their time, on which Woodville, characteristically, takes no stand. The foreground details of recognizable objects - the red spittoon, the umbrella, the penny newspaper, and the discarded "segar" stub - set this drama squarely in contemporary times. 

This small-scale cabinet picture was painted for prominent Baltimore citizen John H. B. Latrobe. Latrobe might have commissioned it in person on his Grand Tour of Europe, which took him "down the Rhine" in 1847. After shipment to New York for a brief exhibition at the American Art-Union, it was delivered to Latrobe's residence in Baltimore on May 29, 1848, with a note from William Woodville V, the artist's father, saying "Caton desires me to say to you, that if you do not like it, you must not hesitate about returning it to me, and he will, with the greatest pleasure, paint another for you."  Apparently, the painting pleased Latrobe a great deal; he loaned it to the first annual exhibition of paintings at the Maryland Historical Society, and it hung in the parlor of his home at Charles and Read Streets until the death of his widow in 1905. 
Woodville exhibited a copy of this work with the title A New York Communist Advancing an Argument to some acclaim at the Royal Academy in London, where he was then resident, in 1852. A woodblock print of the painting illustrated the review of the exhibition in The Illustrated London News, which called it "a spirited little piece . . . of more than ordinary merit." The lithograph of the picture, produced by Fanoli, printed by Lemercier, and distributed by Goupil &amp; Co. included a "dedication to John H. B. Latrobe, Esq." (see fig. 38 and checklist no. 21). It was offered in a full-page advertisement, along with several prints after works by William Sidney Mount, in the December 21, 1850, issue of The Literary World as "a most exquisite representation of American politicians."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"This river has become famous as the great rendezvous of all expeditions to the Far West.  Here the Fur Companies every year meet the Indians, who congregate from all quarters, and specimens of nearly all the tribes may be here seen about the month of August.  The point from which the sketch is taken commands a distant view of the rendezvous, the white Lodges of which are seen on the brink of the river.  From this place after all sales of Peltries are completed, the trappers set out on their Beaver hunt;- here also they provide themselves with 'Heaven's last, best gift, to man'- which is had for a 'consideration.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4). This sketch comes from a Vernon Miller Family Album.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.

    <PublicDescription>Depicted in three-quarter length, the subject turns slightly to the left. Her hairstyle, pulled back in a bun with a cascade of corkscrew curls along the side of the head, was fashionable on both sides of the Atlantic and helps date the portrait to the 1840s. Although she demurely directs her eyes downward, there is strength of character in the young woman's clear gaze and determined expression. The subject is not identified, but she resembles the artist's first wife, Mary Theresa Buckler, with whom he had a tempestuous and ultimately failed relationship. As mysterious a figure as her artist husband, traces of her activities and interests can be found in a ledger book that has descended in the Woodville family, in which purchases of black ribbon, lace, and other sundries are interspersed with entries for food, servants' wages, subscription to a musical library, piano rental, and theater tickets.

Under the direction of Wilhelm von Schadow, the Düsseldorf Kunstakademie had elevated the status of portrait painting, and at least fifty artists were listed in that specialty by the 1830s. Their admiration for the work of Raphael is manifest in numerous portraits of beautiful, demure women, defined by their piety, humility, passivity, and introspection. After a brief period of enrollment in the first class of figure drawing at the academy, Woodville became a private pupil of Carl Ferdinand Sohn, who specialized in such idealized portraits of Düsseldorf's political and artistic elite. Sohn's portrait of Mary Buckler Woodville in an historical costume gives expression, through the set of her jaw and firm anchoring of hands to hip, to the subject's strength of will.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This serene sketch shows animals grazing by a lake with a mountain in the background. The words "Swann Lake" are written at the bottom.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"As the Grizzly bear takes precedence of all his congeners by his enormous weight, power, and ferocious disposition, it is a favorable thing for the hunters that the first impulse of the animal is to escape.  Indeed it is a rule with the Indians and white hunters not to attack him without a strong party, and even then not to press him too closely.  The season in which they are most dangerous occur either at the time when they mate, suffer from hunger, or when they have cubs,- then it is extremely judicious to let them alone.  The hair of the animal is very long towards the Fall of the year, and varies in colour, from grey to dark brown, more or less grizzled by intermixture with grey; when in good condition, they weigh from 1,500 to 1,800 lbs.  Trappers and hunters delight to recount at the Camp fire startling adventures with Bruin, to the 'Green-horn' - enforcing at the same time salutary caution to fool-hardy adventurers - touching this fiercest of all animal tribes found in the mountains." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The scene of action is near the cut rocks.  An Indian on a well-trained horse has separated a Buffalo from the herd and is about to have a shot at him, others are going pell-mell after the tretreating herd among the hills in the background.  In the immediate foreground is a horse unaccustomed to the chase, frightened at the unweieldly brute's noise and confusion about him.  The prairie is admirably adopted to these hunts, from its level surface,- freedom from bogs, quicksand, and interruptions of any kind.  Hunters of the fox in civilized life would consider this hard work,- indeed to make a successful hunter of these huge brutes requires long practice both of men &amp; horses, and is always attended with more or less danger."

    <PublicDescription>"In comparing the Shoshonee, or Snake Indians, with other tribes on our route, we found them superior in many points.  Their horses and equipments were better;- they were more friendly, sociable, and hospitable.  This latter trait is remarkable among uncivilized people.  The Arabs are famous for it.  Ledyard and Mungo Park were relieved and cheered by it among the benighted Africans, &amp; Asiatics and other travellers give testimony to its truth, who have visited the Indian tribes of North America.  We have encamped in the midst of 3,000 Snake Indians near the Rocky Mountains, and have maintained their good will as long as we sojourned with them.  They would send out war parties against the Blackfeet and other tribes, but our intercourse was extremely satisfactory.  The view presented is a quiet evening scene, with Snake Indians looking for a good fording place, on the way to the Camp from a hunting excursion." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"At this encampment we meet some splendid specimens of this tribe, well mounted on good horses, and plenty of them. Their views of the rights of property differ from ours." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In the 1850s, Thom trained in New York at the National Academy of Design and also with the landscape painter George Inness. In 1859 he traveled to France where he studied under Thomas Couture and Pierre Edouard Frère. From 1860 to 1866, Thom worked with Frère in Ecouen. Subsequently, from 1866 through 1873, Thom pursued a successful career in London, specializing in rural genre subjects, he returned to the United States in 1873, settling initially in New York City and later in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey.

William T. Walters compiled an album of drawings on the subject of prayer, which may have included this watercolor.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"Just before sunset these girls have been sent out to search for and bring in the horses,- these have been found, and are making their way home instictively.  The girls are doing something of the same kind, with an addition.  A challenge had been given and a scrub race ensues, the goal being the old Indian Fort located on the distant prairie.  Their long hair is streaming in the wind, and the housings of their horses are gingling and clattering about them to their great delight.  (They are fast girls in every sense of the word, and in their costumes no colors can by any possibility be too bright for them.)  This is a sensible enjoyment.  Few pleasures (we take it) exceed, in this world, that of breathing a fine generous horse over a broad prairie.  The Indian Fort seen on the praire is built of crotched logs, so interlaced with each other that it is impossible to separate, without bringing down the whole mass." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>At the turn of the 20th century Tiffany and Co. produced a number of fabulous, realistic floral brooches. This extravagant example, exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) of 1900 as part of a display intended to highlight the mineral wealth of the United States, was designed by Paulding Farnham. The gems for the blossom were selected by George Frederick Kunz, a renowned geologist and gemologist who worked for Tiffany.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Tiffany was the foremost American exponent of the Art Nouveau movement, which rejected historical styles and called for a re-examination of vegetal and zoological motifs, particularly as seen in Japanese art. He developed it into a sensuous, organic style. The Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, founded in Corona, New York, in 1892, was particularly known for its "Favrile" glass, which imitated the iridescent sheen that ancient Roman glass acquired after being buried for centuries.

    <PublicDescription>"From the foreground the eye of the spectator is conducted through a gentle slope with groups of mountain pines at intervals, to a peninsula jutting out into the glorious sheet of water;- thence it wanders across the Lake to a bare salmon-coloured granite rock, rising abruptly out of its depths, clothed towards the top with stunted trees and hardly evergreens,- still more distant is the eternal ice and snow barrier that shuts in the scene:- the solitary rock lying near the end of the Lake, most probably formed at one time in part of the mountains to the right;- the interval between having become dammed up, and trees growing upon it." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Captain James Lawrence (1781-1813) was mortally wounded on May 6, 1813, during an engagement in the War of 1812 between his ship, the USS "Chesapeake," and the British frigate HMS "Shannon." While being carried below deck, Lawrence is said to have uttered his last command-"Don't give up the ship!"-which became a popular rallying cry of the American navy. Miller was interested in patriotic themes throughout his career. In this early painting, he worked in a tradition of depicting the tragic deaths of military heroes, established by Benjamin West, John Trumbull, and Francesco Bartolozzi.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Whenever the Indians encamp on a favorable stream of water in the Spring and Summer months.  The Indian women (when their taks are finished or domestic duties attended to) set off in search of a shady retired locality, and engage themselves in diving, swimming, and gambolling in the water.  Of this they are remarkably fond and are not at all discomposed by your approaching thier retreat and looking on;- so far from it, that it only seems to produce an emulation among the experts as to whom shall belong the victory of diving and remaining under the water longest, or of swimming the greatest distance.  Not a bit afraid are they either of spoiling thier complexions,- the rich bronze tint of their skin bidding defiance to the rays of the sun." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"As tobacco is a scarce commodity with the Indians they have found a plant of a delicious flavor to mix with it and in default of the former to use in its stead, this is called 'Kinnick, Kinnick,' the leaves resembling in shape the box of the gardens, and is cured by a process similar to that for tobacco.

    <PublicDescription>"When 3 or 4 hunters are together the shot (if valuable) is accorded to the best marksman, for a potent reason, that in this expedition more than 100 hungry men waited for the result and were not to be trifled with. You might have as much fun and jollity as you pleased, - but be sure and bring in the meat. Excuses do not pass current, - ravenous appetites having no reasoning power or sympathy with excuses." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Inman is associated with large-scale portraits, but he also produced miniatures. He was born in Utica, N.Y., and apprenticed in New York City with the American artist John Wesley Jarvis (1781-1840). He helped to found the National Academy of Design and served as its first vice president.

The subject is William Masters Camac (1802-1842), shown at waist length with grey hair parted on the right, seated on a pale red chair, the back of which is visible at the left shoulder. He wears a black coat, black vest, white shirt and black stock tied in a bow.

He died in 1842 at the age of 40, leaving his wife, pictured in WAM 38.470, a wealthy widow.

The frame is not original and is later than the portrait.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"It is a lucky circumstance for Trappers and adventurers in the mountains that this animal [the Cougar] is somewhat rare. He is of the genus feline and as treacherous as he is graceful in his movements. His favorite mode of attack is to lie hidden in the branches of a tree, or amidst some bushes on a over-hanging rock, - pouncing on his prey at a single bound as it passes underneath, or near enough to his place of concealment. ... The sketch will convey an idea of the Cougar's stealthy atttack, an the reception he meets from a self-possessed and wily mountaineer." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>The detailed rendering of this tranquil summer scene is characteristic of Hart's early work, when he was most deeply influenced by the Hudson River school of landscape painting. It was commissioned by the Lord family of Baltimore in the late 1850s, at around the time that William T. Walters was also patronizing the artist.

As child Hart emigrated from Scotland to Albany, then a rapidly expanding industrial hub. In 1852, like many of his fellow artists, he traveled to Germany's major art centers, Munich and Düsseldorf, where he completed his training. From 1857 until his death, Hart was based in New York City, and exhibited successfully in the United States and Europe.

    <PublicDescription>During the early 19th century, stickpins were a popular accessory worn by men as a tie or cravat pin. They came in a variety of precious materials and motifs. So as not to appear feminine, they frequently represented hunting, sporting, or other typically male pursuits. They were also crafted as mourning, commemorative, or souvenir pins. Animals were particularly popular.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"At these crossings our goods were placed on Bull Boats ... A number of Sioux were watching our operations all this time, statue-like on the banks, and although we offered them strong inducements to help us, nothing would move them. We fancied we saw an expression fo contempt on their faces. The trappers, becoming enraged, launched at them the choicest anathemas in French. 'Nursing their wrath to keep it warm.' Luckily for the poor Indians, they understood not a word of these nice expletives, and certainly so far as quiet dignity was concerned, they had the best of it." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Rinehart, the son of a Carroll County farmer, enrolled at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore. Later, he found employment at a local marble yard carving fireplace mantles. In 1855, Rinehart visited Italy for the first time but returned briefly to Baltimore to open a studio. However, with the financial backing of his life-long friend and patron William T. Walters, he returned to Italy and opened his permanent studio in Rome.

    <PublicDescription>"The scene represented is a gorge in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains, at the bottom the water is coming down in cascades caused by the melting snows above and forms one of the numerous feeders to the mighty Missouri.  The defile is comparatively so narrow that the sun only penetrates it at mid-day.  To the left, under some wild cliffs, Trappers are building a cache, out-of-the-way and secluded places are selected for this purpose in order to escape the eyes of prying Inidans.  If the gound has a sod, it is carefully cut and placed to one side, a hole is then dug of sufficient capacity to contain all such articles as are to be deposited."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"In starting our on their war parites, thes tribes, as is their custom, put themselves en grand tenue, donning their best dresses, arming at all points, and using their brightest colors to paint themselves.  Every week while we were encamped amongst them, preparations of this kind might be seen; from one of thes parties we received 3 scapls on their return from a victorious foray, as a great favor.  Take him by the hand pale face and treat him as well as you can.  Don't hold back! Why you would be very like him if your education had been as sadly neglected as his,- besides recollect that with all his faults he has received immense injury from you;- he has sold his birth-right to you for a mess of pottage;- your Jacob has been played with immense energy to his poor character of Esau.  It was an unlucky day for him when he first saw you;- Even now, you and yours persue him with fire and sword to extermination.  You perceive the faults are not all one side, and can well afford to be generous, under the circumstances of the case."  A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Harriet Whipple was the daughter of John Whipple (1784-1866) (see WAM 38.477, by the same artist) of Rhode Island and his first wife Maria Bowen (1772-1836). John and his daughter decended from one of the first settlers of Rhode Island. Harriet married William S. Slater in 1844.

Born in Leeds, England, and trained in an architect's office, Richard Morrell Staigg came to the United States in 1831. Washington Allston encouraged him and he soon devoted himself to miniature painting. He was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy of Design, New York City, of which he was elected an associate in 1856, and an academician in 1861. In the last two decades of his life he devoted himself to portraits, landscapes and genre scenes in oil.

    <PublicDescription>"In the immediate foreground of the sketch an Indian is running a bull-buffalo;- in the middle distance on the prairie is one at bay;- a hunter is provoking and tantalizing him by feints:- he does not precisely wish to lose his life, but merely to see how closely he can go without doing so.  The great mass of buffalo pursued by other hunters are making good their escape through a distant defile, while in the extreme distance, the lofty peaks of the Sweet Water Mountains closes in the scene.  Where one party of hunters are successful, and another less fortunate, they devide the spoils equally, in the most chivalric manner; the motto in vogue is, 'We must help one another,' and we believe this is universal - at least among the whites." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The hunters have brought down the buffalo, Miller noted, "and one has mounted the back of the animal to join in an Indian yell and song;- partly as a species of requiem to the Buffalo for the game quality he has exhibited, but mainly as an act of self glorification for giving the "coup de grace" to the bull.

"The Indian hunters in selecting a buffalo from the herd for themselves are generally much more influenced by the luxuriant coat of hair he wears, in reference to making a robe, than tenderness of beef for roasting purposes.  The party here have secured an animal whose hide will make a first class robe.  Placing him on his haunches in an upright position the conquerer is mounting the animal in full war dress and in his exultation sounds the key note for a 'Yell of Triumph' in which all join.  No description can give an idea of this wild ear piercing manifestation, it is something unearthly serving at the same time as a boast for the visitors and requiem for the buffalo.

"After tanning one side of the robe in which they are experts they often paint on it reminiscences of battle scenes in most brilliant colors, thereby commanding a premium at the agency of the Fur Company... In fact is is indispensable in many domestic purposes among themselves, clothing them in winter and forming the most comfortable couches for repose."

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch will do more than any words we can use in giving an idea of the sublimity and beauty of this scene,- to the left a solid immense rock rises sheer out of the water to a great height,- its dark grey shadow forming a striking contrast to the sharp-pinnacled snow-covered mountains in the distance.  Our leader has caused two ankers of Brandy and Port Wine to be placed on a mule, and when we reached the borders of this charming Lake, it was resoved to christen them the same night.  We are compelled to draw a slight veil over the proceedings.  Suffice it to say, it was a time (as the Trappers style it) of 'High Jinks.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>George A. Lucas, the Paris based art agent of William T. and Henry Walters, noted in his diary under the date of December 24, 1897, that Henry Walters ordered this figure from Proctor on 3 August, that it was cast by Perzinski at Versailles, and delivered on 24 December. The price paid the artist was 700 francs. The figure was Proctor's first composition for the life-size bronzes which he later made for the Q Street Bridge in Washington D.C.. The Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio, owns the bronze models for the Washington statues.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Pierre had several hazardous encounters on the trail- almost drowning, his horse being gored by a buffalo- before he was killed by a wounded buffalo. The incident depicted did not cost Pierre his life but was one in which he could have easily been killed. Miller painted several versions of this scene, including one from another angle.

"His usual practice in hunting the Buffalo was, as he expressed it, to have 'lots of fun'; for this purpose after wounding the animal, he would commence tantalizing him either by displaying a red cloth, or in default of this, running at him suddenly, whooping &amp; causing the animal to chse him in rage and agony.  A Buffalo when wounded fights to the last and dies game;- incidents were not rare in which he would receive 12 Balls before falling;- dashing into a stream, if any was near, to cool his blook occasionally.  The Indians admire and reverence this brave spirit in the animal." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

In rustic Gothic niches at the bottom of the page and from left to right can be seen - a medieval scribe, the Maryland coat-of-arms, and a monk painting. This beautiful page, with its rich colors and abundant use of gold, is clearly inspired by medieval book illumination.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Visionary Landscape," is a fragment of Inness' monumental painting "The New Jerusalem." It was renamed after the artist re-worked the canvas following a serious accident that occurred in Madison Square Garden on April 20, 1880. The original large painting had been lent to an exhibition in the newly built entertainment center, only to be damaged severely when a wall and tower fell in on the gallery killing three people. Recent scholarship has shown that the original painting, thought to have been lost for over 120 years, appears to have been divided by the artist into smaller pieces, which he repaired and repainted removing the religious references. The largest surviving piece of the canvas is now titled "The Valley of the Olives" and is also owned by the Walters (see WAM 37.112).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In late 1839, Miller took his paintings of the American West to Scotland. His patron on the 1837 fur-trading expedition, William Drummond Stewart, had recently inherited a title and several estates including Murthly Castle, near Perth. While there, the artist explored the Scottish countryside.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>When the river was too deep to permit the wagons to cross, the Conestoga wagons were stripped and buffalo hides were wrapped around them. All the goods and equiptment were loaded into them, beginning with the ten-gallon barrels of alcohol (which had been slipped by the authorities, it being illegal to take alcohol to the Indians), and floated across the river. The carts were emptied and floated across on their own. This was a time-consuming process to be avoided if at all possible. Extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>A plaster version of this bust was an early work by Rinehart. After his mother's death in 1868, he created a marble version for himself and several plaster versions for family members. At the sculptor's death in 1874 a plaster and a marble version are listed as being in his studio. It is likely that William T. Walters acquired this marble bust around that time.

    <PublicDescription>Hugh Bolton Jones, an American artist from Baltimore, was a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art from 1865-76. He spent five years living and working in and around the village of Pont-Aven, Brittany, a popular destination for artists such as Paul Gauguin. In Brittany and Spain he made sketching tours, and paintings that resulted from his trip were shown in Baltimore in 1878. He relocated to New York in 1881. He later studied with Frederic Edwin Church, renowned Hudson River School painter, in Jamaica. In this painting, Jones depicts a hunter who has just shot a rabbit. The scene is heavily forested, with four prominent trees and a small hillock.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Some few pocket mirrors carried to the mountains by our people found eager customers among the Indians;- but the men monopolized them, having abundant use for the article in painting their faces and scanning their grim countenances;- a recreation with which they seemed never to tire.  In travelling they suspended them around their necks,- both as an ornament and as a matter of convenience.  The poor women would have made any sacrifice to possess these baubles but not a word of expostulation or complaint was ventured.  Indeed it would be of little avail.  Yet fertile in expedients, the females (especially the younger) find a substitute in nature - posed on the borders of a quiet stream they may be seen watching the reflection of their dusky charms.  Here with a promade of Buffalo Bear's grease, they smooth their Elfin locks of course raven-black hair,- regard with complacency the 'sparkling likeness' of youth and health." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>As a child, the artist became familiar with the Baltimore docks located near the Miller family residence on Market Square. He likely would have seen many "wharf rats" like the one in this sketch.

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, memories of Baltimore, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>Gignoux studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts with Paul Delaroche. He was born in Lyon, France, but emigrated to the United States in around 1840 and opened a studio in Brooklyn. George Innes was his pupil for a short time in 1843. Highly popular in his day, Gignoux painted views of Niagara Falls, New England, and Virginia, and became especially well known for his snow scene, such as this work "Winter Landscape." He returned to France in 1870 and lived there until his death.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This intergenerational drama is set in a sumptuously furnished dining room. A young soldier, his injured left arm in a sling, his boots and trousers mud-spattered, and sword and gloves flung on the carpet, has just returned from service in the Mexican War. Gesturing expansively toward the Revolutionary portrait, he seeks approval from his older relative, who appears lost in memory. Other family members, presumably the soldier's parents and sister, dressed in the fashion of the moment, listen with concern. In the doorway to the right, three African American house servants attend to the conversation. 

Old '76's status as a veteran of the Revolutionary War is made clear by attributes, including knee breeches worn in the previous century, the portrait in military dress on the far wall, and the bust of George Washington behind him. The painting rewards close scrutiny, with such unexpected details as an apple and corncob interspersed with the clock, porcelains, lamps, and book on the mantelpiece, the tabletop still-life, and the adroit rendering of textiles and furniture. The glass on the print of Trumbull's Signing of the Declaration of Independence shows a crack, a symbol of the divisiveness of the political moment. Woodville may have seen this detail in a work of decisive political content in Düsseldorf, Workers before the Magistrateby Johann Peter Hasenclever, painted in 1848. 

One of the puzzles posed by Old '76 and Young '48 is how the artist, living in Europe, acquired his knowledge of the specifics of the Mexican War uniform, in which shoulder straps indicated rank and stripes on trousers denoted different regiments, details that Woodville changed as he completed the painting. No one in his immediate family served in that war, though his friend Stedman Tilghman enlisted as a surgeon in 1846 and succumbed to the strain, dying in New Orleans two years later. Woodville may have studied illustrations in American newspapers or daguerreotypes. Clearly aware of the polarized opinion on this war in the United States, and having suffered a personal loss, the artist takes an ambiguous stance in the argument that is this work's central narrative.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length length portrait of a gentleman facing to the left with eyes towards the observer. He wears a powdered wig, dark blue coat with upright collar, and buff vest with a large lace jabot.

This miniature was purchased from the estate of the Odell family. The Misses Ella and Mary Kearny Odell, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, were direct descendants, through their mother, Elizabeth Ann Bliss, of Judge Jonathan Bliss, of Springfield (1742-1822), Massachusetts, a graduate of Harvard University (1763), who became a Justice of the Peace. In the run-up to the American War of Independence he remained loyal to Great Britain. At the outbreak of hostilities in April 1775, he accompanied Earl Percy on his march to Concord following the skirmish at Lexington. Later in the same year he removed to England, where he lived for nine years, joining the New England Club of Loyalists in London. In 1784 he accepted the Post of Attorney General of New Brunswick, becoming Chief Justice in 1809.

In 1789 he married Mary Worthington (daughter of the Hon. John Worthington of Springfield, Mass.). She died in 1799, leaving four sons: John Worthington, Lewis, William Blowers, and Henry. John died young in 1810, at the age of twenty, but the other sons lived to old age. This miniature likely dates from around 1770. It is possible that the back was remade at a later date to hold the three different locks of hair. We might speculate that this was done for one of the three surviving sons, to include the hair of their father, mother and dead brother.

William Bowers Bliss was adopted by S.S. Blowers, Chief Justice of Nova Scotia. He married Miss Anderson, who was also adopted by Blowers, and they had two sons and three daughters. The eldest daughter, presumable Elizabeth Ann Bliss, married the Hon. William Odell. The miniature then passed to their two daughters, who sold it to the Baltimore collector A. Jay Fink. (For this family history see Chapter Eight, "Hon. Jonathan Bliss," in "The Judges of New Brunswick and their Times," (1907) by Joseph Wilson Lawrence).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch will give you some idea of a band of wild horses engaged in their rough amusement and frolicsome pastime of biting and kicking, while some are rearing and striking with their fore-feet.  The popular idea that they have sentinels posted to give an alarm must have arisen from the circumstance of the stallions feeding apart at some distance from the main band.  Being thus isolated they take in a wider range than the mares huddled and feeding together.  Their hot and fiery blood causes them to take alarm at the slightest movement,- so that when they start a general stampede takes place, and in a very few minutes the prairie is bare and not one of them is to be seen." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>Francis Scott Key is most famous for writing a poem which, set to music, became the national anthem of the United States. Key was a lawyer by profession. He was born in Maryland and died in Baltimore. 

Joseph Wood was born in New York near Clarkston. In 1802 he established himself as a miniature and portrait painter, and for some time was a partner of John Wesley Jarvis. After the two artists separated, Wood moved his studio to Washington. Towards the end of his career he supported himself by executing drawings for patent applications. Wood's name also appears in the Baltimore directory, and from 1816 practiced in that city. He is known to have painted a picture of Key in 1816 for John Randolph of Roanoke, and at least five versions were identified in public and private collections in the 20th century.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Ellen Walters (1822-1862), the wife of William T. Walters, was the daughter of a prosperous Philadelphia merchant. She died at the age of 40, leaving her husband with two children to raise: Henry (1848-1931) and Jennie (1853-1922). To paint this miniature 35 years after Ellen's death, the artist worked from a daguerreotype made in 1846, the year of her marriage.

William Jacob Baer was born in Cincinnati in 1860, where he was trained in lithography. In 1880 he traveled to Munich to study drawing and painting at the Royal Academy. When he returned to the United States, he lived in New Jersey where he taught drawing and painting at Princeton University. In 1893 he moved to New York and where he first painted portrait miniatures; by 1894 he had given up easel painting all together to focus exclusively on this genre. He helped found the American Society of Miniature Painters, and is considered instrumental in the revival of miniature at the end of the 19th century. Baer exhibited both nationally and internationally, at the Exposition Universelle (1900), Pan-American Exposition (1901), Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904), and the Panama-Pacific Exposition (1915), where he work was well received. He seems to have found particular success with Henry Walters and his relatives. The Walters Art Museum holds six works on ivory by the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In this elegant, colorful portrait, a companion to Walters 37.2558, Miller excels as a portraitist. He shows his sister-in-law standing with her back to a mirror, which, in turn, reflects her bare neck and shoulders. Hanging from her right shoulder is a red velvet drapery with a green lining. Beside her on a table is a bowl containing a large goldfish.

Mrs. Decatur H. Miller, née Eliza Credilla Hare, was the daughter of Jesse Hare of Lynchburg, Virginia, and Baltimore, and of Catherine Welch (who is portrayed by Miller in another portrait owned by the museum, WAM 37.2467). Her father was an extremely wealthy tobacco manufacturer who introduced the use of licorice in the manufacture of chewing tobacco. Eliza was married to D. H. Miller on October 14, 1847.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Blauvelt studied with Charles Loring Elliott and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. He pursued a career as a genre and portrait painter, before settling in Annapolis, Maryland where he taught draftsmanship at the Naval Academy. Blauvelt was among the artists whom William T. Walters encountered during his forays in the New York art market just prior to the Civil War, acquiring 5 works by the artist. Blauvelt specialized in small genre paintings, frequently of single figures.

Showing an elderly carter at a bar, this painting can be read as a less innocent pendent to WAM 37.1951, which shows a young boy standing in front of an open stove.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"After an exciting chase over the prairies, the Indian hunters have at length driven the Elk just where they would like to have him.  The Elk in his extremity has plunged into the Platte River, and making for the opposite shore, while the hunters are approached the margin at full gallop, knowing very well that if he is not captured before he reaches the other side, there is slender chance for them.  Even in the water he is a dangerous customer, for he has a trick of using his long horns to great advantage, and keeping his enemies at bay.  The Platte varies from half a mile to three quarters in breadth at this point, and when swollen by recent rains, is a formidable and rapid river,- very often however it is so shallow that charettes cross it without water covering the hubs of the wheels.  The pie-bald horse is held in great esteem,- the manner in which the Trappers described their breeding was similar to that used by Jacob of old among Laban's flocks of cattle." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Frances Platt Townsend was born February 17, 1779, daughter of Dr. Platt Townsend, a physician in the City of New York. Frances was married on March 27, 1803 to Lancaster Lupton,  a lawyer, also from New York City, the son of a wealthy merchant, William Lupton. Sadly the marriage only lasted 6 months, as Lancaster Lupton died in August of that year before their only child, Elizabeth, was born. Frances never remarried and her only child only lived to be 14. The three members of this family are buried together in the Trinity Churchyard in New York City. Frances died March 5, 1833, aged 54. The hair on the back of the miniature was perhaps a later addition to include the hair of her husband and daughter, alternatively it could be a combination of her own hair and that of her husband.

Frances is listed in the New York Historical Society's "Dictionary of Artists in America, 1564-1860" as a "sculptor, miniaturist and landscape painter." She was an Associate member of the National Academy of Design and she exhibited at the National Academy in 1828, 1829, and 1831, and in 1829 she presented to the City of New York her bust of Governor Throop. 

This miniature was commissioned around the time of Frances' marriage. There is a note in Malbone's record book (no. 21, page 50) for May or June 1806 which reads "Mrs Lupton's niece Miss Townsend, pd. 50."

Malbone traveled to London with Washington Allston where he was mentored by Benjamin West. In London he changed his style of painting learning to allow the luminosity of the ivory to emerge through washes of transparent color. He was highly productive after his return to Charleston in December 1801, sometimes painting three miniatures a week. Malbone traveled to major American cities for commissions over the next four years. He died in 1806 of tuberculosis, shortly after completing this miniature. He was perhaps the most influential American miniature painter of his time and after.</PublicDescription>

    <CreditLine>Acquired by Henry Walters (?)</CreditLine>
    <PublicDescription>This miniature, signed "Sully 1797," was acquired with a paper suggesting it had been presented by Thomas Sully of Richmond, Virginia, to Mr. Edmund Roots of Richmond. A small number of other non-portrait miniatures by Sully are known; one, a memorial to his mother, can be found in the collections of the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven [accession number 1940.536]. A Mr. Roots is listed in Sully's register of portraits for 1805.

An alternative theory is that this miniature was painted by Sully's older brother, Lawrence Sully, who was a miniature and device painter, and who, like Thomas, lived in Richmond in the last few years of the 18th century (see Edward Biddle and Mantle Fielding, "The Life and Works of Thomas Sully, 1783-1872," 1921).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Henry Ossawa Tanner is regarded as one of the most distinguished African American painters. He received his training at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia under Thomas Eakins and at the Académie Julian in Paris. After 1895, he lived in Paris and painted religious works inspired by his travels in the Holy Land. Tanner produced few portraits and only a couple of these were sculptures. The bust is slightly less than life size and this, combined with its slightly rough finish, suggest that it is a study for another, more finished, piece.

Represented here is the artist's father, Bishop Benjamin Tucker Tanner (1835-1923), a distinguished cleric in the African American Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church. In 1866, the senior Tanner was pastor at the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Baltimore, and later he served in Frederick, Maryland. Twenty years later, he became a bishop in Kansas City. Bishop Tanner was also a writer and poet and published books pertaining to the A.M.E. Church.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch represents an encampment of Shoshonee Indians, near Green River, Oregon.  On the elevated ground, or bluff, are a group of Indians in painted robes.  On the plain below they are preparing jerked meat, this is performed by cutting it up into thin slices and laying it on frame work, composed of crotched sticks supporting poles;- under these a suppressed fire is built, so as to smoke and dry it at the same time.  Before we started from St. Louis we became acquainted with Capt. Sublette, who was then a substantial merchant in that city.  He had been one of the pioneers to the 'Far West' and almost the first thing he did was to hand us a piece of this prepared meat so as to give us a foretaste of mountain life.  He told us that every season he caused a bale of meat to be brought down to him which lasted 6 or 8 months.  The Indians and Trappers, after having prepared it properly, fold it in smoked buckskin and stow it away either for Winter consumption, or as a provision in making journeys where game is scarce." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Woodville painted himself several times during his short career. In this charming small work on panel, the artist sits in a parlor chair, facing the viewer while looking off to the left. His casual but fashionable attire includes a haphazardly buttoned tan jacket, a white shirt with black bow tie, a gray vest, and blue-green trousers with a checkerboard pattern - the height of contemporary fashion. Woodville holds an awkwardly proportioned black top hat in his green-gloved left hand; his ungloved right hand frames his face in a gesture of contemplation. The light brown wallpaper, with its repeating pattern of bouquets of pink roses, places the scene squarely in the domestic realm. 

Notable in this painting, as in others by the artist, is the contrast between the broadly worked clothing and awkward proportions of the headwear and the miniaturist technique of the carefully rendered face. The racially charged "science" of phrenology popular in the early decades of the nineteenth century held that inner character showed in external signs, particularly the head, "the seat of the intellectual . . . and moral organs."  Woodville painted his own visage with loving detail, giving himself the broad forehead, aquiline nose, and white skin touched with color held up as the Anglo-Saxon ideal. The hand-to-face pose, suggesting pensive introspection, is found frequently in works after photographs during this period, as it held the head still through the long exposure the medium required. Woodville's career coincided with the popular introduction of the daguerreotype portrait; already in 1842, one of his professors at the University of Maryland Medical College, William A. E. Aiken, dabbled in the new technology.

A photographic portrait of the artist from Düsseldorf (location unknown) shows that the painting was true to life. A Baltimore schoolmate remembered Woodville was "of aristocratic lineage, courtly manners and very handsome, he was essentially the artist."  Already in Baltimore, he was sensitive to his appearance, and in Germany, his young wife noted in her ledger books numerous expenditures typical of a man of fashion: gloves, cravats, and costumes along with club dues, models, art supplies and "segars."

    <PublicDescription>The sitter is the wife of Joseph Anthony, Jr., Gilbert Stuart's first cousin, who trained as a silversmith, and subsequently opened a business in Philadelphia, eventually making the transition from craftsman to entrepreneur. On December 29 1785, he married Henrietta Hillegas (1766–1812). A Philadelphia native, she was the daughter of Michael Hillegas, the first treasurer of the United States. This minautre is a pendant to WAM 38.436. The miniatures were perhaps made to celebrate the couple's betrothal. The miniatures are both after oils by Stuart, which today can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Stuart worked closely with the miniaturists Walter Robinson and Benjamin Trott, both of whom painted miniatures after Stuart's portraits in oils. It is possible that this miniature is by one of these men.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The incident of the sketch is an every-day ocurrence.  Parties of from 2 to 4 men start out every morning after breakfast in different directions to supply porvisions for the camp;- having been unsuccessful on the prairie, they have come down to the backs of the River Eau Sucre;- and in default of Buffalo, are now ready to bag anything that offers;- Mountain Pheasant, Hare, Geese, Ducks, and 'such smaller deer' are welcome.  The Rocky Mountain pheasant is totally unknown in the States,- being nearly as large as a full grown turkey;- feeding principally  on Artemesia gave a wild and rather bitter taste to its flesh.  The Hare of this part of the country is also sui generis, and in taste not perceptibly different from rabbit,- A large tortois was occasionally captured, altogether different from any we had before seen.  Its outside shell (top and bottom) was soft." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>The sitter Joseph Anthony, Jr. (1762–1814), was Gilbert Stuart's first cousin, born in Newport, Rhode Island. He was the son of a successful sea captain, and trained as a silversmith, opening a business in Philadelphia, and eventually making the transition from craftsman to entrepreneur. He became prominent in local society and was one of the original subscribers to the Philadelphia City Dancing Assembly Fund. In 1785, he married Henrietta Hillegas, who is depicted in a pendant to this miniature WAM 38.437. These miniatures were perhaps made to celebrate the couple's betrothal and are both after oils by Stuart which today can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Stuart worked closely with the miniaturists Walter Robinson and Benjamin Trott, both of whom painted miniatures after Stuart's portraits in oils. It is possible that this miniature is by one of these men.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The lavish use of colored gemstones in this piece is thought to reflect the influence of Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933), the artist and glass designer, who served as director of the "Artistic Jewelry Department" of Tiffany &amp; Co. following the death of his father, C. L. Tiffany, in 1902. This necklace was purchased as a wedding present for Ellen du Pont Wheelwright whose house, "Goodstay," is in Wilmington, Delaware.

In the center of the pendant is a large blue zircon surrounded by canary diamonds alternating with smaller diamonds of various hues, green demantoid garnets, and amethysts. The triple chain is of platinum links and variously colored pearls.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Nina Moore, alternately listed as G. Nina Moore and Mrs. Nina Moore, or incorrectly as Nora Moore, is typical of many 19th-century women artists in that little is known about her life and career. She exhibited at the National Academy of Deign in 1857 and again in 1866. Other exhibits are known, the last in 1875 at the Essex Institute in Salem, Massachusetts. The composition may be related to the genteel art of collecting and pressing leaves. Moore has included shadows, emphasizing that the leaves are not yet fixed to the page. The curious presence of two signatures leads to the discovery that the composition functions equally well when the painting in turned upside down.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>As his reputation grew, the prices for John Wood Dodge's work rose from $11.50 to $75.00. Largely self-taught, Dodge also practiced photography in his later years. This early portrait of the future 11th president of the United States may date to 1824, the year of Polk's marriage to Sarah Childress.

The portrait shows Polk waist-length looking slightly to the right with bushy fair hair. He wears a black coat, white vest, white shirt and high chin collar. A lock of brown hair can be found on the reverse and does not appear to be that of the sitter.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Because William T. Walters had once provided him with financial assistance, Elliott presented this self-portrait to him with the accompanying note:

"You will gratify me by accepting the accompanying portrait of myself, as a slight testimonial of my esteem for you, and I also wish to express my admiration for your manly, consistent, and liberal support of American art."

Elliott also apparently painted a portrait of Walters, but the whereabouts of this work is currently unknown.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This miniature is a reduced copy of a full-sized oil painting by Gilbert Stuart of George Washington: the so called "Athenaeum type," after the best known example in the Boston Athenaeum. The high-lights are enhanced by strips of silver foil applied at the back of the ivory. After Washington's death in 1799 miniatures of him were very popular among Americans who wore and displayed them as a sign of respect, patriotism and mourning well into the 19th century.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The warrior is here waiting impatiently for his costume.  Wrongs have accumulated to that extent in his mind, that nothing but sanguinary vengeance will restore his equanimity.  The dress is being made by his squaw, it is sewn throughout with sinew, and is a most substantial and serviceable work.  The body made of the best Antelope skin, and the whole decorated profusely with dyed porcupine quills of all colours, beads, scalps etc.  The cap or helmet is filled with Eagle feathers so as to extend to the knee joint.  The quiver is filled with arrows, and when all is ready, he does his enemy the honor to make elaborate toilet, - mounts his horse and is gone."A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In 1969, then Federal Government's Bureau of Reclamation employed artists to portray its reclamation of "the arid West" through water management. In addition to Herman Maril, other well-known artists were selected including Norman Rockwell and Richard Diebenkorn. Each painter was provided with transportation to the various sites and was permitted to choose any subject provided that it could be related to the Bureau's mission.

Herman Maril chose a site in New Mexico where the Willow Creek confluences with the Chama River. The river flows through a variously colored sandstone canyon which descends at points to 1,500 feet.

The artist suggests the grandeur of the scene through the unusual scale of his canvas and by his use of large patterns of colors.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The sketch represents a Dacotah Mother fondling a papoose, with a little dusky imp near her in the shape of a son. To the right is a temporary lodge of twigs or osier bent, and the ends firmly fixed into the ground; pieces transversed are secured to these, and over this frame is stretched blankets, buffalo robes, or anything in fact that will answer for a covering; as it is only 4 feet in height, the occupant can only creep in and lie down... In the middle distance is an Indian preparing dried meat. The meat is first cut into thin slices, laid on a frame over the fire and smoked, packed into bundles, and laid by for scarcity in provender, or for winter use." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Darley was primarily known as an illustrator in the 19th century. He worked for "Harper's Monthly" and numerous famous authors of the day, including James Fenimore Cooper, Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Washington Irving, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. In the 1840s he signed a contract with Edgar Allan Poe to work on his journal the "Stylus." The project never materialized, but he did provide illustrations to Poe's short story "The Gold Bug." Darley is known to have produced lithographs of Native Americans; this may be a study for one of these prints.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>"In a large company of men, horses, wagons and equipments, the crossing of rivers is quite an undertaking and, if deep, involving considerable risk and damage.  The company's good and the produce must be kept dry at all hazards.  In the first place guides are sent out to cross and explore the river at different points, in order to find the best places for embarking and landing, and when the river is deep, the goods must be all unladen from about 30 wagons and charettes, transferred to boats, and ferried across."A.J.

    <PublicDescription>This watercolor is a study for La Farge's "Resurrection" window of 1894 for the First Congregational United Church of Christ, Methuen, Massachusetts, a memorial for local industrialist Henry Coffin Nevins (1843-1892). The enormous window measures 17 feet across and 11 feet high, and is said to contain some 8,000 pieces of glass. Julie Fanchette Henriette Nevins (d. 1904), Nevins' widow had brought La Farge to see the church in 1892, but unimpressed by the space he pursuaded her to build a new chancel with a single monumental window opening to frame his work. The chancel was designed by La Farge's son, the architect C. Grant La Farge of the firm Heins and La Farge (see James L. Yarnall, "John La Farge: A Biographic and Critical Study," 2012, p. 212). Christ appears in the center of the design in white surrounded by light, while robed figures to either side push away dark clouds. The finished window follows this study very closely (see Adams, Foster et al, "John La Farge," 1987, p. 214-218).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>After everyone had arrived at the rendezvous, the Snake Indians, led by Chief Ma-wo-ma, staged a grand entry in honor of Captain Stewart.  "Some of the dresses were magnificent,"  Miller wrote as he recalled the parade, "and although vermillion was worth four dollars per oz., a lavish use of that article was exhibited on their bodies and faces."  Miller's friend, the missionary William H. Gray, was otherwise impressed, noting that some of the marchers were naked or hardly clothed at all.

Miller worked his sketches into a large oil version of this scene (now in the collection of the Oklahoma Historical Society) after he returned to Baltimore in 1839.  He shipped it to New York for exhibition and transport to Liverpool.  It was shown at the Apollo Gallery as a sequel to his spring and summer exhibition that had already been shipped to Murthly.  This small watercolor was a part of the commission that Miller received from William T. Walters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>This statue depicts an incident in the life of one of the sculptor's daughters, who had avidly followed the hatching and rearing of a nest of birds, only to be overcome with grief when the fledglings departed. Palmer, who was self-taught, was among the first American sculptors to break with the prevailing neoclassical style and adopt a more naturalistic approach.

    <PublicDescription>Miller did  not see this scene, which occurred during one of Captain Stewart's earlier trips to the mountains, but it was explained to him in detail and he painted several versions of it, including a large painting approximately 5 x 9 feet for Murthly Castle and this fine watercolor.

According to LeRoy R. Hafen's account of the incident ("Broken Hand," p. 134), a band of young Crows invaded the camp while Fitzpatrick was away and Stewart was in charge. They carried off stock, pelts, and other property. They encountered Fitzpatrick on their return and stripped him of everything of value as well. As Stewart described the incident, the Crow medicine man had told the braves that, if they struck the first blow, they could not win. Thus, they had to provoke Stewart or someone in his party into striking the first blow. Stewart stood firm, refusing to strike. The Crows left, and the captain survived a situation in which he would have surely lost the battle. Fitzpatrick managed to talk the Crows into returning most of what they had taken.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

This watercolor is of one of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe, a family that toured America in the middle part of the 19th century.  Among the Ravels' most long-standing successes was a two-act pantomime set in Russia, "Godenski, or the Skaters of Wilnau," in which the tribulations of the young lovers, Ludoviski and Ludoviska, follow the lines of the traditional harlequinade. The comic suitor, Godenski, is rescued in a skating scene in which roller skates were used for the first time in America.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"This scene represents an Arapaho Indian en famille, smoking his pipe and reposing under a blanket suspended from the branches of a tree, to screen them from the sun.  We saw some fine speciments of this tribe.  They do not shave their heads like the Sioux, but braid the centre or scalp lock with ribbons or feathers of the 'War Eagle.' We noticed also a difference in their moccasins, the fronts extending only to the instep and wanting the side flaps.  Indians are capable of designating a tribe very often by merely having the moccasins.  The Arapahos were tall, finely formed men, from 5 ft. 8 in. to 6 ft. in height. In setting out on their war parties, the process of painting, dressing, and adorning themselves occupies considerably of their time and attention.  When a party is seen scouring over the prairies under thes circumstances it bodes no good to theose they happen to encounter.  As regards their steeds, they have no geldings &amp; we saw none, except those brought from the States.  The animal thus preserves all his game spirit &amp; is capable of great endurance.  They partake somewhat of the Arabian breed."    A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"While the train pursued 'the even tenor of its way' we usually started out with the hunters in order to get sketches and observe the incidents connected with the chase.  Antoine was our preference as he took more pains to carry out our wishes.  His aim was so true and his knowledge of the animal's habits so perfect that he could would a Buffalo in such a manner as to make him stand still for a time.  This would give us an opportunity to approach the fiery brute and make drawings,- sometimes A. would urge us to go closer, but on doing som th Buffalo would make a plunge toward us- 'his eye in a fierce phrenzy rolling'- throwing down pencil and paper, a retreat in doubly quick time would be made, at which our fidus Achates would laugh cosumedly."

    <PublicDescription>"From the elevated rock in the foreground, from whence the sketch was taken, a wide expanse of land, declining gently to the margin of the Lake, spreads out before you , broken up with groups of trees.  To the left the rocks rise abruptly from the bosom of the Lake, and behind these rocks a junction takes place with the Lake:- to the North of this.  The peak covered with snow in the distance to the left of the sketch is the highest of this range,- probably not less than 15,000 feet above the prairie.  Silence reigned supreme over this beautiful sheet of water, only as long intervals broken by the descent of an avalance, crashing through the trees and amongst the rocks."  A.J.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

The nameless little servant girl was invited by Dick Swiveller to play cribbage in his room in Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" (1841). After she nursed him through a serious illness, Mr. Swiveller married his "Marchioness." Miller was particularly drawn to the works of Dickens and drew illustrations to "Barnaby Rudge," "Martin Chuzzlewit," and "Little Dorrit," as well as "The Old Curiosity Shop."</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Miller often used witty captions or lines of dialogue to reveal more about the characters in his sketches. He provided the following caption for this piece: "You must move on 'old bottle nose' - the city won't pay you anything for holding up the lamp post." 

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Chimney Rock, along the Platte River, is one of the first unusual formations that Miller saw.  A remarkable column approximately 150 feet high when he saw it, the rock is made of clay with strata of rock running through it.  In his novel "Edward Warren" (pp. 155-156), Stewart commented that the rock, "seen in the mists occasioned by the evaporation of a wet region around, represents Parthenons and Acropolises, fortifications or cathedrals..."

The column has deteriorated today, but is still a prominent landmark, a recognizable remnant of an earlier era.

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"This was about the best specimen we came across of the women belonging to the Aricara tribe, which has dwindled into a small nation from war and other causes. The subject of the sketch was admired by the trappers, - of a rich bronze complexion, with long hair streaming over her shoulders, and extremely glossy from the constant use of Buffalo and bear oil."

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"It is only in savage life that real and absolute liberty exists.  This man bears about the appearance of it.  We can see at a glance that he is not troubled with taxes,-by the same token, we could almost affirm that he has left no Mrs. Caudle in his lodge to give him a "bit of her mind" on his return home.  A pipe, the great solace of his leisure hours, is lighted and he is exhaling the smoke in volumes from his mouth and nostrils alternately, with a thorough enjoyment of its aroma.  The great difficulty is that he has too much freedome for his own good..  It causes him to be proud, overbearing, and oppressive.  Eventually he carries measures with such a high hand and becomes so intolerably tyranical that it is found essential to knock him on the head.  This he comrehends better than a long harangue, and may be calle the Agumentum baculinum; in fact it is resoning to him as plain as a pike-staff.  No successful bully has yet existed, who, sooneror late, has not bet his fate from one who is still more powerful, and as Corporal Nym would say, 'That is the moral of it.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This "single incident that arrested the Artist's eye" proved to be a popular picture that, perhaps as much as any other image, seemed to show the Indians to be a carefree, romantic lot.  Miller later permitted it to be copied as a chromolithograph for C. W. Webber's book entitled "The Hunter-Naturalist: Wild Scenes and Song-Birds" (1854).  As might be anticipated, later editions of the work had the girl fully clothed, despite Miller's note that "she had in truth, almost 'nothing to wear.'" A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"The scene here presented is remarkable, huge mounds of rock rise suddenly out of the prairie, and near their summits and scattered about their sides were boulders seemingly detached,- while the dry sand plain below is covered with gnarled bushes of the Artemesias.  From these plants, found here in the greatest abundance, the atmosphere is strongly impregnated with the smell of camphor and turpentine.  Theis whole region from its elevation and purity of air is said to be favorable to the resoration of health, particularly to consumptives,- the respiration of air so highly charged with aromatic plants no doubt contributes to this influence.  Our hunters had great sport here with the Mountain sheep, wherever they could get access to them.  In ascending the rocks in herds, they gave notice of their locality by the loose stones that came rattling along the declivities, and thown down by them in running - when in good order the meat was similar to our mountain mutton." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>"There is considerable ingenuity and taste displayed in the structure of these permanent Lodges,- upright posts with crotched ends are first raised supporting bond timbers at different heights to give a sloping circular roof:- rafters radiating from the centre rest on these, and are secured in their places by transverse pieces leaving narrow interstices - the whole of the frame work is now covered with adobe, both roof and sides, which completes the Lodge.  The light is admitted through an aperture in the center and the smoke finds egress through the same.  The subject of the sketch presents a favorable specimen of a permanent Lodge, with groups of Indians scattered about; at the upper end are some Indians seated, playing one of their favorite games,- the 'game of hand' - it had a strong resemblance of our game of 'hunt the slipper.' Many persons conceive that Indians always carry a grave countenance.  We have seen them 'laugh consumedly' while engage in this favorite pastime." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Bust-length portrait of a dark-haired young lady in décolleté white muslin dress or wrap and blue scarf. The sitter has a long string of pearls around her neck, from which is suspended a miniature of a man in a three-corner hat. She holds this miniature in her left hand.

This miniature has been attributed to Charles Fraser, a painter of miniatures, portraits in oils and landscapes. He spent most of his life in his native city of Charleston depicting its leading citizens. There is another almost identical miniature in the Gibbes Museum, Charleston (accession number XX1902).

The frame post-dates this miniature.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"In the spring these animals commence shedding their hair,- the old winter coat of a pale dull brown comes off in great flakes exposing the new short hair of a lustrous umber color.  About the month of June they appear to the greatest advantage.  A bull at this time with his body bare and his head and shoulders muffled in long hair makes a very formidable appearance, his wieght being upwards of 2,000 lbs.  Among animals, the wolves and grizzly bear are his greatest enemies;- the former are only successful with the weak and sickly Buffalo, but with the latter the strongest Bull goes down before him.  We suppose that no traveller who makes the journey to Oregon ever forgets afterward the delicious flavor of the Bos or Hump rib,- it is probably superior to all meats whatsoever, and the preparation for securing it is the subject of our present sketch.  The choiciest parts are this, together with the fleece, side ribs, &amp; tongue, which are places on a Sumpter mule, and dispatched to camp." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller.

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Miller labeled this sketch "4th July 'The day we celebrate.'" The older woman does not enter into the spirit of the holiday, being startled by fireworks.  

Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>"The Trappers experience much difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of the Indian tongue, and as if the language was not embarrasing enough, its pronounciation is still more puzzling,- the sound proceeding from the throat.  It requires them to sojourn for years amonst the tribes to acquire anything like a proficiency, and in the absence of this they resort to signs, the meaning of which they learn readily, and thus hold animated conversations.  Many of the half breeds however are well versed in the lingo of the various tribes of Indians;- these are sought out for interpreters, and travel with the Camp, making themselves useful also in other matters and duties connected with the Comapny, such as hunting, mounting Guard, &amp;c." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

    <PublicDescription>Although formerly thought to have been carved by a sailor on a New Bedford whaler, this whale-tooth ornament falls outside the traditions of New England scrimshaw. The sculptor has treated the subject with remarkable realism, thus permitting ornithologists to identify the model as a bald eagle. The only inaccuracy in the rendition is the nostrils, which would open through the beak rather than through the cere, the soft tissue at the base of the bill.

    <PublicDescription>"The Valley of the Olives," is the largest surviving fragment of Inness' monumental painting "The New Jerusalem." It was renamed after the artist re-worked the canvas following a serious accident that occurred in Madison Square Garden on April 20, 1880. The original large painting had been lent to an exhibition in the newly built entertainment center, only to be damaged severely when a wall and tower fell in on the gallery killing three people. Recent scholarship has shown that the original painting, thought to have been lost for over 120 years, appears to have been divided by the artist into smaller pieces, which he repaired and repainted removing the religious references. The Walters also owns a smaller fragement titled "Visionary Landscape" (see WAM 27.2775).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The wanderers are a branch from the great tribe of Snake Indians, and call themselves Shoshocoes - in contra-distinction probably to Shoshonies, the name of the parent tribe.  They are very poor, and subsist mainly on the roots of the earth,- but a mild inoffensive race;- the trappers stated to us that they were not permitted by the war-like tribes to hunt the Buffalo.  'Hark you? Clinker (says the eccentric Matthew Bramble), you are convicted by your own shewing of poverty, sickness, and of being a vagabond, and have not a friend in the wide world.- this is highly reprehensible, and for it you deserve condign and exeplary punishment.' Here is your sentence varlets! - and it is meted out to you by your brother Indians.  Thank your stars that you do not live near a civilized community.  There would be something worse in store for you! They are somewhat ingenious, and construct bowls and jugs out of a kind of basket work, - they make a serviceable rope also from hemp found in their vicinity." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The Gospel of John relates the story of a Samaritan woman who is asked by Jesus for a drink of water. After talking with him, she realizes that he is the Messiah. Rinehart represents the woman, standing with her water vase. A native of Maryland, the artist, with the financial help of William T. Walters, settled in Rome in 1858. There, he sculpted idealized figures as well as portraits of visiting Americans. He worked in a neoclassical style but was also influenced by the emerging naturalistic trends in sculpture.

Two large marbles of this subject were cut (the original order for William T. Walters and one for Governor Edward D. Morgan of New York in 1874) and eight reductions.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. In this drawing Miller depicts the lighthouse at Niagra Falls.

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher. He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The varied interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: rural sites, studies after Old Master paintings, illustrations of literature, and comical scenes and characters. 

This sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.

    <PublicDescription>During an 1886-89 stay in Paris, this Boston painter experimented with working in oils outdoors. He gradually abandoned the dark-toned palette of the Barbizon masters for the brighter colors of the French Impressionists. Hassam named this study of a nude model, painted as if posed on a cliff, after the siren in the German poet Heinrich Heine's "Die Lorelei" (1827). In the poem, the Lorelei, a water spirit dwelling in the treacherous rocks along the Rhine River, lures ships to their destruction with her tantalizing singing:

Night falls as I linger, dreaming,
  And calmly flows the Rhine;
The Peaks of the mountains gleaming
  In the golden sunset shine.

A wondrous lovely maiden
  Sits high in glory there;
Her robe with gems is laden,
  And she combs out her golden hair.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"So far as sketching was concerned, the borders of these Lakes offorded the best positions for views, as the water did not rise in too sudden a perspective, and the eye commanded with ease the full extent of mountain scenery beyond;- but we were eternally debating the question of ascension to the extreme summits- "We never are, but always to be blessed" Were we contented? No! What now? - we wanted to go to the tops of the gilttering peaks above us.  The truth is the Sirens were singing to us, and very like fools we were listening too.  At last a strong practical voice places a veto on the project, and if Ulysses in Sicily could have possessed himself of the same determined will, he need not have filled his sailors' ears with wax." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"On approaching this famous land-mark, when within 10 miles of it, we were struck with its resemblance to a huge tortoise sprawling on the prairie;- this appearance lessening in proportion as we came nearer.  We found it pomposed of granite or coarse porphyry, from 5 to 600 ft. in height, and in a prominent part were inscribed the names of the pioneers of the Rocky Mountains, among others the names of Sublette, Wyeth, Cambell, Bonneville, Pitcher, &amp;c., many carved deep into the stone.  The temptation was too strong not to add our own;- to make amends for this assumption, and show our zeal for others, we found a man by the cognomer of Nelson had carved his name, and to insure him immortality we added to it, 'Of the Nile!' 'Odds chisels and hammers' (as Bob Acres would say0, what a pity it is he will never know his benefactors.  

When we first came in view of the Rock, Buffalo were feeding under its shadow, and the swift-footed Antelope bounding along so fleetly and so phantom like that we almost imagined them to embdy the spirit of departed Indians, again visiting their beautiful hunting grounds and scenes of former exploits."

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).

    <PublicDescription>"The Kansas Indians live pretty much now on the recollection of the past: -the future for them is entirely hopeless.  Somewhat like the Beggars of Spain, who congregate about old ruins and amuse themselves by relating to the other legends of hidden treasures; - and former glories.  This tribe reverts to a by-gone period, when game was plentiful around them, and the skilful use of their bows and arrows gave them an abundance of food for their lodges.  In the sketch a Kansas Indian is recounting to a Trapper the remembrances of his youth, when the Buffalo in countless herds traversed the prairie, and wild horses in large bands were captured and converted to their use.  All these have disappeared, and the only mementoes now left are the skulls of Buffalo lying about the prairie and bleaching in the sun.  They are in receipt of Government annuities, but from several causes these are injurious to them.  In a few, very few years, they will be swept from the face of the earth, and the places that now know them shall behold them no more-forever." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

In July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"Creeping with the stealthiness of a cat towards his prey, perfectly understanding the nature of the animal he has to deal with, watching his chances with great patience and perseverance, added to this his experience and subtlety, make the Indian a most successful hunter, - the game too is worth all the trouble, the Elk being of the dimensions of a large-sized mule. The meat, although somewhat coarse, is excellent when the animla is in good order."

    <PublicDescription>The sitter, from Media, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, was often resident in Baltimore and Philadelphia. Unlike Rinehart's bust of Mrs. Walters, which shows the sitter in modern dress, Eliza Farnum is shown in a classicising chemise with drapery across her chest.

Rinehart was a Maryland native who ran a successful sculpture studio in Rome. William T. Walters may have sponsored Rinehart's first trip to Italy in 1855, and he remained a close friend and patron throughout the rest of the artist's life. Wealthy Americans visiting Rome would make tours of sculptors' studios, view their work, and place commissions. This bust was modeled from life during just such a visit, perhaps during Mrs. Farnum's (née Leiper Smith) honeymoon; she was married in 1865.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>"The hunters form for themselves a peculiar kind of a cap;- it has two ears with a flap reaching to the shoulders,  This is worn with a double object in view, one of which is to deceive the Buffalo in approaching,- under such guise, the hunter is mistaken by the animal for a wolf, and is suffering to approach quite near.  The mass of hair covering the forehead of the Buffalo obscures his sight and aids the trapper in his deception.  In the sketch a couple of Bulls are lying down near the swell of a rolling prairie. A trapper ( in company with an Indian) is stealthily creeping along the rise,- as the arrows of the latter make no noise, he is privileged to shoot first, the Trapper reserving his fire until the animals regain their feet, when he instantly 'draws a bead,' using his ramrod to steady his rifle. This mode of hunting is used only under certain circumstances;- running being the favorite method, from its affording more excitement." A.J. Miller, extracted from "The West of Alfred Jacob Miller" (1837).

    <PublicDescription>Rembrandt was the son of the well-known Neoclassical portraitist, Charles Willson Peale, who used his influence to launch his children's careers as artists. In 1795, Charles used his connections to get 17-year-old Rembrandt a sitting with the growing American legend George Washington. Rembrandt would later paint many portraits of Washington, as well as of Thomas Jefferson. 

The younger Peale enjoyed a long, prosperous career, churning out likenesses of the most distinguished members of Colonial America. Due to heavy demand, he often relied on studio assistants. Consequently, the mature work can seem slightly formulaic. However, this early work, probably done at about the same time that the precocious young artist was introduced to Washington, has a refreshing liveliness. The sitter, whose profession and identity remain somewhat unclear, is captured as though directly engaging us. He points to a skull, which is typically used in still-life painting as a symbol of human mortality.  Scholars have not yet determined if the prominent skull refers to the sitter's professional status (a medical doctor?) or if it has some other, as yet undeciphered symbolical role.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.

Depicted here is one of the original members of the Ravel PantomimeTroupe, a french family that toured America in the middle of the 19th century. The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Baltimore artist Alfred Jacob Miller is known primarily for his paintings of the American West, but his interests extended beyond this subject. A prolific sketcher, he filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), studies of works by the Old Masters, literary illustrations, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In this scene of quiet domesticity, an old woman sits with her feet propped on a hassock, looking pensively into the distance. The young girl at her side reads from a large book. Such details of costume as the woman's lace ruff and the girl's unfinished carved chair place this in the seventeenth-century period context that was prized by American collectors and fashionable among Düsseldorf artists in the period before the American Civil War. The relationship between generations that is a recurrent theme in Woodville's work is treated here as contented coexistence. 

One of the defining social transformations underway in the early decades of the nineteenth century was the physical separation of male employment from the home, as industry became more concentrated and the population grew more urban. The developing middle class coped with the rigors and anxieties of this new economic structure in part by imbuing the home with deep associations of private refuge. The "separation of spheres" by gender placed women at the center of domestic life, where their role, according to a contemporary etiquette book, was to be "a corrective of what is wrong, a moderator of what is unruly, a restraint on what is indecorous." Many of Woodville's genre works are set in the rough-and-tumble public sphere of primarily male interaction, and exude a sense of anxiety about the ambiguous relations between strangers in anonymous public spaces. In this painting, which descended in the family of his second marriage, he turned from the unruly and indecorous external world to the calm and quiet of the home. The fact that the two subsequent generations of that family were accomplished artists may account for the inconsistencies of paint application in this unfinished work.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>The inscription engraved inside the cover of this Tiffany and Company pocket watch reads "From your devoted friend Pembroke Jones." Jones was a wealthy Southern merchant and financier who Henry met in Wilmington, North Carolina in the 1890s. The two men became close friends, sharing a common interest in sailing. The case of the watch, made of red gold, is decorated with Henry's initials in white and yellow gold. It would have been worn on a chain like the one threaded through Henry's waistcoat button-hole. In 1922, three years after Jones died, his widow, Sadie, married Henry.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This lovely book is a catalog of blue-and-white Chinese porcelain from the collection of Sir Henry Thompson (1820–1904). Thompson collaborated on the illustrations with James McNeill Whistler, one of the most prominent artists of the Aesthetic Movement, which advocated "art for art's sake." Several letters from Whistler are bound into the volume. For the binding, Charles Meunier incorporated porcelain plaques into his design of prunus blossoms and featured Whistler's famous abstract butterfly signature.

    <PublicDescription>Henry Ossawa Tanner is regarded as one of the most distinguished African American painters. Tanner received his training at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia under Thomas Eakins and at the Académie Julian in Paris. After 1895, he lived in Paris and painted religious works inspired by his travels in the Holy Land. This painting dates from ca.1897 and is probably set in Palestine. It appears closely related to another painting of several lions from around the same date: "Lions in the Desert" (1897-98) in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. Like the lions in the Smithsonian's painting, the lion in this work bares a strong compositional resemblance those seen in the work of Jean-Léon Gérôme. Tanner depicted lions throughout his career, and they may have had a special symbolic meaning for the artist.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>Published by the Grolier Club, a prominent bibliographic society of which Henry Walters was a member, this book details the history of the Charles Whittinghams, an uncle and newphew who founded the Chiswick Press, one of the most famous fine presses of nineteenth-century London. It is one of an edition of 385, printed on handmade paper and bound in 1898 by Charles Meunier. The binding features the Grolier Club's insignia, a cipher of interlocking G and C, and Henry Walters' personal HW monogram. The tool used to make the monogram design is held in the Walters Archives (A.13). A second copy of The Charles Whittinghams Printers, also bound by Meunier, is held the Walters rare book collection (92.1208).</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>In 1889, the Grolier Club of New York City published this three-volume edition of Richard de Bury's Philobiblon (The Love of Books), essays on librarianship composed in 1344. Founded in 1884, the Grolier Club is one of the most influential bibliographic societies, and Henry Walters was a member. Léon Gruel included the club's insignia in the binding, which he gave to Walters as a token of his admiration. Triple back-to-back bindings are extremely rare; Gruel explains in his dedication that this is the only one he had ever made.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This Léon Gruel binding on a volume about modern bookbinding techniques displays a variety of styles produced by Gruel's workshop, intended to show the range of effects that Gruel could achieve for his clients. The front cover displays modern designs, while the back cover showcases antiquarian ones. Both covers feature "modeled leather," a technique in which the leather is stretched and shaped to create depth and texture.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This intricate style of binding from the 16th and 17th centuries, composed of a central oval surrounded by dense gold tooling, is known as the "fanfare" style. The binding, created by Léon Gruel, is an exact copy of the binding of Le Nouveau Testament de Nostre Seigneur Jesus Christ (Walters 92.182). Gruel was proficient at binding in antiquarian styles, but he also branched out in modern directions.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>White damask table napkin from Henry Walters' yacht, Narada, with dot-and-floral motif and the word Narada in chain-stitch cursive at a 45-degree angle from the lower corner.

In 1896 Henry Walters purchased a 224-ft. steamyacht from the Philadelphia banking heir Anthony Joseph Drexel, Jr., which he named Narada, after a wandering Vedic sage found in early Hindu texts. Henry, like J. P. Morgan, William Rockefeller, and numerous members of the Vanderbilt family, was a prominent member of the New York Yacht Club. With other club members, he sponsored entries into the America's Cup, and was elected vice-commodore. The Narada was scrapped in the 1930s, but the Walters Art Museum owns this napkin, as well as the yacht's chronometer (WAM 58.266): an extremely accurate timepiece used to help calculate location while at sea.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>An African American artist who undoubtedly faced daily obstacles and racial prejudice as a "free colored person" or "mulatto," Duncanson was hailed in 1861 as "the best landscape painter in the West." Based in Cincinnati, Ohio, Duncanson was one of several artists who depicted the Ohio River Valley and the vast North American landscape. He sometimes included ruins in his idealized landscape scenes, as here, which can be read as metaphors for the decay of civilization. In this painting, which has a misty glow and luminosity characteristic of his work, Duncanson also included several small, finely dressed black figures engaged in leisure activities, launching boats and socializing along the shore. Although Duncanson's paintings rarely addressed issues confronting African Americans, he imbued his depictions of them with subtle meaning. During his career, Duncanson achieved great fame in Canada, England, and Europe.</PublicDescription>

    <PublicDescription>This jug is representative of aesthetic movement pieces popular among American middle-class consumers in the 1880s and 1890s, at a time when Arts and Crafts style home-furnishings were reaching a broader audience. The color of the jug is subdued, created by the mixture of local clays used, rather than a glaze. The gold and silver raised decoration takes the form of a Japanese inspired motif, typical for aesthetic movement decorative arts of this period. The decorating was done by hand at the company, typically by female workers trained at the Maryland Institute School of Design in Baltimore. D.F. Haynes and Co. introduced this kind of Severn Ware in 1885. Using local clays from in and around Baltimore it also produced several other colors of stoneware, each marketed under a name that emphasized their Maryland origins, including Arundel, Calvertine, and Avalon (this last in reference to an estate of Lord Baltimore’s).

Of special interest is the attribution of this design to James Callowhill (1838–1917), one of the Callowhills who worked on the watercolors of William T. Walters’ Asian ceramics, which were turned into fine lithographs by Louis Prang under the title Oriental Ceramic Art in 1897. James’ stay at the Chesapeake Pottery Company (as it was then named) was short, spanning just two years (1885 to 1887).</PublicDescription>
